October 1: Document Classification fun time
==
This week: I give you guys code (with lots of comments lol) for document classification using naive bayes. 
The example was pulled from hackerrank.com. 
An example of what this kind of classification can be used for is categorizing news articles, discovering sentiment (positive, negative, etc) of text, etc. 

Before next week you should understand what the code is doing and how everything ties in together. 

Next week I'll show you how to apply the code in real life. We'll code a web scraper to go through a news website and classify the news articles for us using the classifiers we've written. 

If you're having trouble following the code / understanding it / want to learn more / etc, the facebook post is here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/444540012332237/permalink/448378245281747/
