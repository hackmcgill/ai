October 1: Document Classification fun time
==
This week: I give you guys code (with lots of comments lol) for document classification using naive bayes. 
The example was pulled from hackerrank.com. 
An example of what this kind of classification can be used for is categorizing news articles, discovering sentiment (positive, negative, etc) of text, etc. 

Before next week you should understand what the code is doing and how everything ties in together. 

Next week I'll show you how to apply the code in real life. We'll code a web scraper to go through a news website and classify the news articles for us using the classifiers we've written. 

If you're having trouble following the code / understanding it / want to learn more / etc, the facebook post is here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/444540012332237/permalink/448378245281747/

Running the code
==
- Make sure you have Python and sklearn (the learning algorithm library) installed on your computer. If you don't want to install this stuff, the McGill computers in the Trottier lab have python 2.7 and sklearn installed on them for you.

- Download main.py and data.txt onto your computer, put them into the same folder.

- Run main.py using python, it will read in the data, build a classifier from it and spit out some stats. The data.txt contains training data for the classifier.
