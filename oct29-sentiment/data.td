2013-10-29T20:30:23Z	@PeteO I think $AAPL had no other chance than to dump big when Jim Cramer and Brian $1111 White recommend it within 24 hours.
2013-10-29T20:29:52Z	@sp1202012 Yup, $FB $GOOG $AAPL all want what $YELP has.
2013-10-29T20:28:51Z	$AAPL if we get another 6 upgrades tomorrow maybe we can go down another 12 points
2013-10-29T20:27:39Z	@1brayden Of course, but they should have included this in actual release &#39;36.5-37.5 (after -1% software deferral)&#39; bad job. $AAPL
2013-10-29T20:27:29Z	@ArcAngelCapital I think for something contrarian to work, it has to be an EXTREME sentiment. That was not $TTWO. It was $AAPL.

2013-10-29T20:25:36Z	@bman1 Running $AAPL and serving greedy WS are two polar opposite targets. Cook does what he&#39;s been hired for - and that&#39;s not serving WS.

2013-10-29T20:30:23Z	@PeteO I think $AAPL had no other chance than to dump big when Jim Cramer and Brian $1111 White recommend it within 24 hours.
2013-10-29T20:29:52Z	@sp1202012 Yup, $FB $GOOG $AAPL all want what $YELP has.
2013-10-29T20:28:51Z	$AAPL if we get another 6 upgrades tomorrow maybe we can go down another 12 points
2013-10-29T20:27:39Z	@1brayden Of course, but they should have included this in actual release &#39;36.5-37.5 (after -1% software deferral)&#39; bad job. $AAPL
2013-10-29T20:27:29Z	@ArcAngelCapital I think for something contrarian to work, it has to be an EXTREME sentiment. That was not $TTWO. It was $AAPL.
2013-10-29T20:26:22Z	$AAPL $ goes -&gt;$GOOG
2013-10-29T20:26:10Z	So much pessimism for $AAPL and $CRUS
2013-10-29T20:26:02Z	$AAPL just going to wait for $GOOG  $AAPL pair trade to reverse again ...  nothing else will move this stock
2013-10-29T20:25:36Z	@bman1 Running $AAPL and serving greedy WS are two polar opposite targets. Cook does what he&#39;s been hired for - and that&#39;s not serving WS.
