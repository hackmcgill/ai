3 indianapolis colts owner and ceo jim irsay is a man who isnt afraid to speak his mind his twitter feed is constant proof of that his willingness to speak his mind occasionally gets irsay in hot water this time though its his team thats going to pay for irsays big mouth with the colts coming off a listless loss to the san diego chargers and getting ready for a matchup with the undefeated denver broncos irsay picked now to tell jarrett bell of usa today his thought process behind the series of events that led to the release of quarterback peyton manning and the selection of andrew luck with the first pick in the nfl draft weve changed our model a little bit because we wanted more than one of these irsay says flicking up his right hand to show his super bowl xli championship ring tom brady never had consistent numbers but he has three of these irsay adds pittsburgh had two the giants had two baltimore had two and we had one that leaves you frustrated you make the playoffs times and youre out in the first round seven out of times you love to have the star wars numbers from peyton and marvin harrison and reggie wayne mostly you love this then irsay flicks up his right hand again no really he said that out loud irsay who said that manning told him youve got to take andrew characterized the tony dungy and manningled team that won super bowl xli as jekyllandhyde schizophrenic compared to this years powerrunning luckled club if that wasnt a shot at manning than it has to be the most backhanded compliment in history before we go any further none of this is any sort of indictment of luck head coach chuck pagano or the colts themselves even after the setback in san diego the colts are in first place in the afc south and they showed with wins over the seattle seahawks and san francisco 49ers that indianapolis is a team to be reckoned with but seriously what was irsay thinking first off the notion that peyton manning was somehow to blame for the colts only appearing in two super bowls and only winning one is preposterous from manning led the colts to nine straight 10win seasons he won the nfl mvp four times while in indianapolis in addition to the two super bowl appearances manning and the colts made it to within one game of the super bowl in yes the colts suffered a number of postseason setbacks and manning wasnt at his best in many of those games neither was the defense opposing quarterbacks like ben roethlisberger and tom brady had something to do with that too if luck enjoys half the success in indianapolis that manning had hell be considered a hero in any event dungy isnt buying what irsays selling according to mike klis of the denver post via will brinson of cbs sports i can tell you it wasnt a nobrainer i was on the phone with jim irsay probably five or six times over a month as it was leading up to that he knew all those factors that you just enumerated there but jim also had a great deal of loyalty jim was a young boy when his dad traded johnny unitas so he knew the ramifications of this type of decision and he also knew how much peyton had done for the city of indianapolis and for that franchise so even for all the reasons you just stated why it should be done i dont think it was ever a nobrainer in his mind and i can almost guarantee you that if he knew he was going to be healthy like this and playing this kind of football in hindsight i dont think he would have done it lets say for arguments sake that dungy doesnt know what hes talking about and that irsay hasnt had a single moment of regret or secondguessing since the colts eschewed manning for luck manning vs luck playercomp att pct yardstdintratingrecordmanning17824074 22179222128 860luck11518661 813467389 642den at ind week 7that still leaves this small matter jim irsay taking a shot at peyton for not winning more championships is not the smartest thing he couldve done this week colts broncos tom kessenich tomkessenich october 2013why would any sensible person pick now as the time to make these statements peyton manning is an immensely proud quarterback who is presently at the helm of an offense thats on pace to rewrite the record books last weeks passing yards against the jacksonville jaguars was the first time all season that manning failed to throw for yards irsays ringtapping theatrics was a slap in the face to a player who is on a pace for every singleseason passing record worth having publicly manning will blow this off hell say all the right things hell profess his respect and admiration for irsay and his love for the colts and the time he spent with the team that may all be true its also true that you can bet the rent that manning is seething privately you can also bet the rent hes going to take it out on the colts sunday way to go jim follow idpmanor
3 on monday respected san francisco 49ers receiver anquan boldin held an online video chat with fans via the bay area news group and shared some strong words for the nfl regarding player safety a few minutes into his q and a session a fan asked boldin what he thought of the recently released pbs documentary league of denial which is critical of the way the nfl has handled concussion protocol while boldin said he didnt see the documentary and initially praised the league for the steps it has made to be proactive against head injuries he said he doesnt agree with the concept of thursday night games you can watch his statement at the mark of the video below via bay area news group here is the full text of boldins quote but there are some things that just dont make sense to me if youre so concerned about player safety then why do you have every team in the league playing on thursday night when they just competed on a sunday knowing exactly how difficult it is for guys to get back to being healthy after playing on sunday guys really dont feel like theyre back til probably thursday or friday to prepare for that next week the league can say theyre doing things to protect guys but im not one of the guys buying it thats a strong statement from an 11year veteran with the license to speak his mind it also comes just a week after former baltimore ravens teammate terrell suggs also had some sharp criticism regarding the nfl and theleague of denial documentary via jeff zrebiec of the baltimore sun suggs on league of denial from their standpoint i think theyre looking forward to covering their own ass more than player safety jeff zrebiec jeffzrebiecsun october 2013for commissioner roger goodell approved a measure to have all nfl teams play one game on thursday night football throughout the year and it has become a weekly ratings boon according to press releases via zap2it com the sept thursday night matchup between the philadelphia philadelphia egles and kansas city chiefs attracted million viewers making it the highestrated thursday night football game ever on nfl network last weeks game featuring the new york giants and chicago bears reportedly attracted million viewers and had a bigger audience than mlbs game alds playoff matchup between the detroit tigers and oakland as andrew burton getty images with weekly ratings like that tnf probably isnt going anywhere anytime soon goodell has caught some flack for pondering other options like expanding the regular season to games but at what point does player safety trump the revenue goodells tenure as commissioner has been a tenuous one as he touts the leagues desire to promote player safety and awareness but his actions speak otherwise and boldin has a valid point the league looks like its pushing aside safety for more money two football games in the span of five days may be good for fans but its unhealthy for the people who make it happen the players

3 realistically speaking the tennessee titans are exactly where even the most optimistic people saw them being at this point with a record you could even argue that the titans have vastly exceeded expectations so far this season after such a dismal season the fact of the matter is that the titans are following the path that i saw them goingonheading into week with them finishing an eventual and in the mix of a wildcard spot if jake locker had to get injured it honestly came at the best time when the titans found themselves facing opponents that were better anyways to be blunt thats not to say that locker couldnt have been the difference maker in their losses to the chiefs and seahawks but it would sting a lot more if these losses came to divisional opponents with locker on the sidelines powerless you have to figure that the titans will drop to with yet another great defense coming up in the san francisco 49ers ryan fitzpatrick has shown that he is what he is which is a backup quarterback even with the expected loss to the 49ers theyre still on pace to finish if they take care of business where they should the shocking struggles of the houston texans means that the titans are in even better shape sitting just one game behind the indianapolis colts for first place in the afc south afc south standings teamrecorddivision recordconference recordpoints forcolts421022148titans330132128texans241021106jaguars06010470nfl comwhat makes this current twogame losing streak so tough to swallow is how theyve lost these last two games in both games you cant point to a couple of plays that changed the eventual outcome the texans loss still stings the most when you analyze where the titans sit right now they can easily overcome that loss but a win there would really have this team in excellent shape to push for a division crown if youre head coach mike munchak at this moment you have to be generally pleased with where the titans sit in the standings considering how much easier the latter part of the schedule gets munchak is in the drivers seat of securing his role as head coach of the titans for at least a few more seasons as long as he can continue to be successful in games the titans are supposed to win meetings with the jacksonville jaguars st louis rams oakland raiders and arizona cardinals are all games the titans should win after seeing how theyve played through six games splitting with the colts and the texans gets them to that 10win mark and that would have to be considered a very successful season to build on however its getting close to the breaking point of panicking a bit if the run game doesnt get going soon its really starting to hamper a passing offense that has the ability to be great when balanced with a formidable rushing attack the odds dont look favorable that shonn greene will be able to return this week according to craig peters of the titans official website greenes return would vastly improve the titans chances of maybe getting a win against the 49ers but his hopeful return after the bye week should help lead to plenty of wins down the stretch finally you cant count this team out with the way the defense is playing right now theyre keeping the titans in games and just getting gassed in the fourth quarter that epidemic can be solved if the running game can improve however thats the big question with this team moving forward the quality of opponents will be exactly what the doctor ordered for this running game and that will send a ripple effect throughout the entire team that will end in wins instead of close losses a coveted bye week coming up will be key to if the titans can really hit the accelerator and make this a successful season theres still plenty of games to be played and the titans are in a great spot right now despite the last two losses its no time to panic
2 frances win over finland at the stade de france ensured that les bleus finished fifa world cup qualifying group i in second place behind spain goals from franck ribery olivier a joona toivio own goal and substitute karim benzema did the damage in a relatively comfortable victory for didier deschamps side a win for spain over georgia ensured that the french could not finish higher than second place but going into the playoffs les tricolores will be unseeded their dismantling of their mediocre scandinavian opponents will send a warning signal out to their potential playoff opponents though and follows on from the impressive demolition of australia ribery started proceedings for france with a thumping finish from outside the area on eight minutes after creating the chance for himself the fc bayern munchen man drilled his effort in off the underside of the crossbar ribery is quite simply a fantastic player jerome pugmire jeromepugmire october 2013the hosts could have immediately added to their tally but they were wasteful in front of goal frances complacency began to creep in as the first half progressed finland came back into it creating a few chances of its own but it could not take the opportunities that it made for itself kasper hamalainen and roman eremenko looked to cause deschamps side problems but neither could find a goal olivier giroud made them pay on minutes with a towering header meeting a pinpoint cross from the excellent mathieu debuchy that toivio could only send into the roof of the net goal to france giroud claiming it but its substitute joona toivio who smashed it into the roof of his own net frafin ffw frenchftweekly october 2013karim benzema replaced the arsenal man shortly afterwards six minutes after coming on the real madrid man made it three some excellent play from ribery on the left resulted in a sublime cross that benzema did well to hook in from close range thanks to brilliant movement 30 its two in two now for benzema his movement is brilliant on the goal perfect cross from ribéry too julien laurens laurensjulien october 2013the score line did not flatter les bleus who gave deschamps an encouraging 45th birthday present it could have been perfect had georgia managed to do the unthinkable and pull of a win in albacete though with a solid but unspectacular win a clean sheet will be a huge boost despite a less than convincing defensive showing overall france showed togetherness that has been missing lately while ribery was their talisman on such form they look a dangerous opponent robin bairner rbairner october 2013key player grades franck ribery a julian finney getty images frances main man on the night was ribery central to everything his goal and assist for benzemas third demonstrated his individual importance to the side on this sort of form you will be left wondering what else the 30yearold has to do in order to win the fifa ballon dor if he does not sweep the gong this year for helping les bleus to qualification while his teammates took their foot off the gas after the opening goal ribery was constantly probing for openings and looking every bit the talisman that he has become for france recently his opening goal was nothing short of sensational ribery at his best losing his men before driving home from outside of the area to immediately put the hosts onto the front foot julian finney getty images mathieu debuchy aa surprise nomination in the top three players from the match but it is deserved as debuchy was massively impressive for france given his chance against both australia and finland due to bacary sagnas injury the newcastle united man has impressed with two good performances a constant menace from right back debuchys speed and work rate on the flank created problems for the finns not only was his linkup play with samir nasri mathieu valbuena and ribery encouraging he also found himself in some dangerous positions in front of goal debuchys most telling contribution though was his cross that created the second goal a beautiful deep ball into the box that giroud knocked goalwards with a towering header that toivio could only send into his own net he almost added a second assist minutes later with a second cross but loic remys header came back off the post julian finney getty images olivier giroud b three goals in two games for giroud in this recent international break caps an impressive contribution from the arsenal man the 27yearold did not get the same service he enjoyed against australia but he still made a nuisance of himself in the finland defence girouds goal was well taken but his target man performance will have perhaps been more encouraging to deschamps it was by no means a vintage showing but the former montpellier man was functional and provided the physical presence that enabled ribery in particular to thrive honorable mentions julian finney getty images karim benzemas goal deserves individual mention although he was only on the pitch for a short space of time the real madrid man made the most of his limited opportunity following a goal scoring substitute appearance against australia benzema did exactly the same against finland although the finish was of a higher class riberys assist may have been sensational but the movement required of benzema to be in a position to score from was also impressive his celebration after a lovely hooked finish demonstrates the confidence beginning to flow within the out of favour real madrid striker once again b e n z e m a does a bit of shadow boxing to the crowd after scoring to make it after more superb work from ribery jerome pugmire jeromepugmire october 2013although there was little for finland to cheer on the night the result belied a few individual performances kasper hamalainen looked excellent and was a constant source of trouble for france roman eremenko also posed the hosts some difficulties and stood out in an otherwise mediocre

evening aleksandr kislitsyn committed a foul in the box in the 16th minute allowing keane to score his 61st international goal by foolingkazakhstan goalkeeperandrey sidelnikov on a penalty to knot the

unleashed a wellstruck ball past the irish defense and into the back of the net seamus coleman had helped set up the goal with a misplaced clearance attempt that sent a spell of silence over the crowd kazakhstan who are also out of world cup contention seemingly had all the momentum at that point they were ahead early on a reeling irish side who had sackedgiovannitrapattonijust last month but shomkos goal would be the only time kazakhstan held any semblance of the momentum jamie mcdonald getty images the irish side looked rejuvenated under king who is holding fort until a permanent replacement can be named they controlled possession from the outset working the ball around the perimeter of the kazakhstan defense and waiting for their perfect time to strike holding for just under threequarters of the match ireland were able to hold off the visiting side and prevent them from even getting the ball past midfield for much of the match oshea capitalized on thekazakhs inability to properly clear in the 26th minute he knocked through a rebound attempt afterrichard dunne nearly scored on a failed cornerkick clearance it was the second goal of the sunderland defenders international career in caps with the score in their favor ireland worked hard to hold possession and avoid any costly mistakes and for the most part they succeeded david forde faced only two shots on goal as the irish defense did an excellent job of blocking attempts deep in the zone and forcing mistakes by pressuring the ball jamie mcdonald getty images on the rare instances wherekazakhstanwere able to get a clear attempt they went nowhere after shomkos early score in fact the kazakh midfielder even gave one back to his opponents scoring an own goal after a dashing run into the middle by substituteaiden mcgeady that goal finalized the score and ireland were easily able to drain out the remaining time to end their world cup qualifying season on a high note they will finish in fourth place in group c as germany and sweden will move on for their shot at glory with just five total points kazakhstan nestle in at fifth place in a sixcountry group the match for both sides comes with minimal connotations both had long put away their dreams of heading to rio next year and the only possible positive for ireland is that they may improve their seed for euro were many months and

3 arsenal supporters got about the worst news possible as mesut ozil limped off in germanys world cup qualifier the midfielder was substituted in the 82nd minute and immediately went back to the dressing room rather than the bench per swiss ramble on twitter ozil substituted hate to say it but he walked straight to the dressing room with a slight limp swiss ramble swissramble october 2013the good news is that ozil didnt have to be stretchered off thats when you get worried as a supporter because thats one of the telltale signs of a longterm problem at the very least he was able to walk off the pitch on his own power so the severity of the injury may not be serious however any sort of injury problem could potentially be a major blow for arsenal since ozil is one of the biggest reasons they are top of the league table since moving from real madrid the 25yearold has been one of the gunners best players in four premier league appearances hes had three assists and hes also tallied a goal and an assist in two champions league appearances losing one of your best players could end up in dropping points that prove the difference between first and second at the end of the season
3 pittsburgh steelers players better not get too comfortable with anything they might find fun or entertaining because head coach mike tomlin might just up and ban it losing isnt fun a sentiment shared by any team going through tough times however tomlin seems determined to take all the fun out of the steelers current campaign cbs sports ryan wilson spotted this tweet from mike prisuta quoting the coach from tuesdays press conference no more flying leaps and flips into the end zone for steelers tomlin that would be very correct its a potential for injury its silly mike prisuta dvemike october 2013if you are scoring at home tomlin isnt a fan of the sillinessat least not this season joe camporealeusa today sports if you recall the pittsburgh postgazette reported back on october that tomlin decided to ban games like ping pong andshuffleboard in the locker room nfl coms chris wesseling reports veterans initially started that ban for all players with less than four years of service eventually tomlin tired of theseparationcaused amid players and just up and banned everyone from playing games ryan clark stated at the time from his point it was dividing the team in a way the safety continued one sect of people couldnt do a certain thing and he just wanted everybody to be togetherbecause were all in the losses together now it has to be stated that nobody has any fun when the team loses athletes are just like we nonathletes they have stressful days at the office and like to blow off steam however its clear tomlin wants to set an example that more than letting loose and relieving stress the team needs to come together and win as for the ban on touchdown flipping we arent about to chide coach for making a call that is certainly his to make if he thinks it will save the team from some dumb injury down the road more power to him there certainly needs to be a ban on kickers celebrating to keep them from hurting themselves normally this is the point that we would lambaste the league for again proving to be no fun but this is a coach trying his best to set the tone for some semblance of a revitalized season we tip our hats and tell you steelers to keep the touchdowns coming but refrain from somersaulting into the end zone just know that the steelers may be heading into their week clash with the baltimore ravens but they are all business from here on out unless business becomes fun and then tomlin might ban that too hit me up on twitter follow gabezal

3 on monday respected san francisco 49ers receiver anquan boldin held an online video chat with fans via the bay area news group and shared some strong words for the nfl regarding player safety a few minutes into his q and a session a fan asked boldin what he thought of the recently released pbs documentary league of denial which is critical of the way the nfl has handled concussion protocol while boldin said he didnt see the documentary and initially praised the league for the steps it has made to be proactive against head injuries he said he doesnt agree with the concept of thursday night games you can watch his statement at the mark of the video below via bay area news group here is the full text of boldins quote but there are some things that just dont make sense to me if youre so concerned about player safety then why do you have every team in the league playing on thursday night when they just competed on a sunday knowing exactly how difficult it is for guys to get back to being healthy after playing on sunday guys really dont feel like theyre back til probably thursday or friday to prepare for that next week the league can say theyre doing things to protect guys but im not one of the guys buying it thats a strong statement from an 11year veteran with the license to speak his mind it also comes just a week after former baltimore ravens teammate terrell suggs also had some sharp criticism regarding the nfl and theleague of denial documentary via jeff zrebiec of the baltimore sun suggs on league of denial from their standpoint i think theyre looking forward to covering their own ass more than player safety jeff zrebiec jeffzrebiecsun october 2013for commissioner roger goodell approved a measure to have all nfl teams play one game on thursday night football throughout the year and it has become a weekly ratings boon according to press releases via zap2it com the sept thursday night matchup between the philadelphia philadelphia egles and kansas city chiefs attracted million viewers making it the highestrated thursday night football game ever on nfl network last weeks game featuring the new york giants and chicago bears reportedly attracted million viewers and had a bigger audience than mlbs game alds playoff matchup between the detroit tigers and oakland as andrew burton getty images with weekly ratings like that tnf probably isnt going anywhere anytime soon goodell has caught some flack for pondering other options like expanding the regular season to games but at what point does player safety trump the revenue goodells tenure as commissioner has been a tenuous one as he touts the leagues desire to promote player safety and awareness but his actions speak otherwise and boldin has a valid point the league looks like its pushing aside safety for more money two football games in the span of five days may be good for fans but its unhealthy for the people who make it happen the players

3 realistically speaking the tennessee titans are exactly where even the most optimistic people saw them being at this point with a record you could even argue that the titans have vastly exceeded expectations so far this season after such a dismal season the fact of the matter is that the titans are following the path that i saw them goingonheading into week with them finishing an eventual and in the mix of a wildcard spot if jake locker had to get injured it honestly came at the best time when the titans found themselves facing opponents that were better anyways to be blunt thats not to say that locker couldnt have been the difference maker in their losses to the chiefs and seahawks but it would sting a lot more if these losses came to divisional opponents with locker on the sidelines powerless you have to figure that the titans will drop to with yet another great defense coming up in the san francisco 49ers ryan fitzpatrick has shown that he is what he is which is a backup quarterback even with the expected loss to the 49ers theyre still on pace to finish if they take care of business where they should the shocking struggles of the houston texans means that the titans are in even better shape sitting just one game behind the indianapolis colts for first place in the afc south afc south standings teamrecorddivision recordconference recordpoints forcolts421022148titans330132128texans241021106jaguars06010470nfl comwhat makes this current twogame losing streak so tough to swallow is how theyve lost these last two games in both games you cant point to a couple of plays that changed the eventual outcome the texans loss still stings the most when you analyze where the titans sit right now they can easily overcome that loss but a win there would really have this team in excellent shape to push for a division crown if youre head coach mike munchak at this moment you have to be generally pleased with where the titans sit in the standings considering how much easier the latter part of the schedule gets munchak is in the drivers seat of securing his role as head coach of the titans for at least a few more seasons as long as he can continue to be successful in games the titans are supposed to win meetings with the jacksonville jaguars st louis rams oakland raiders and arizona cardinals are all games the titans should win after seeing how theyve played through six games splitting with the colts and the texans gets them to that 10win mark and that would have to be considered a very successful season to build on however its getting close to the breaking point of panicking a bit if the run game doesnt get going soon its really starting to hamper a passing offense that has the ability to be great when balanced with a formidable rushing attack the odds dont look favorable that shonn greene will be able to return this week according to craig peters of the titans official website greenes return would vastly improve the titans chances of maybe getting a win against the 49ers but his hopeful return after the bye week should help lead to plenty of wins down the stretch finally you cant count this team out with the way the defense is playing right now theyre keeping the titans in games and just getting gassed in the fourth quarter that epidemic can be solved if the running game can improve however thats the big question with this team moving forward the quality of opponents will be exactly what the doctor ordered for this running game and that will send a ripple effect throughout the entire team that will end in wins instead of close losses a coveted bye week coming up will be key to if the titans can really hit the accelerator and make this a successful season theres still plenty of games to be played and the titans are in a great spot right now despite the last two losses its no time to panic

and follows on from the impressive demolition of australia ribery started proceedings for france with a thumping finish from outside the area on eight minutes after creating the chance for himself the fc bayern munchen man drilled his effort in off the underside of the crossbar ribery is quite simply a fantastic player jerome pugmire jeromepugmire october 2013the hosts could have immediately added to their tally but they were wasteful in front of goal frances complacency began to creep in as the first half progressed finland came back into it creating a few chances of its own but it could not take the opportunities that it made for itself kasper hamalainen and roman eremenko looked to cause deschamps side problems but neither could find a goal olivier giroud made them pay on minutes with a towering header meeting a pinpoint cross from the excellent mathieu debuchy that toivio could only send into the roof of the net goal to france giroud claiming it but its substitute joona toivio who smashed it into the roof of his own net frafin ffw frenchftweekly october 2013karim benzema replaced the arsenal man shortly afterwards six minutes after coming on the real madrid man made it three some excellent play from ribery on the left resulted in a sublime cross that benzema did well to hook in from close range thanks to brilliant movement 30 its two in two now for benzema his movement is brilliant on the goal perfect cross from ribéry too julien laurens laurensjulien october 2013the score line did not flatter les bleus who gave deschamps an encouraging 45th birthday present it could have been perfect had georgia managed to do the unthinkable and pull of a win in albacete though with a solid but unspectacular win a clean sheet will be a huge boost despite a less than convincing defensive showing overall france showed togetherness that has been missing lately while ribery was their talisman on such form they look a dangerous opponent robin bairner rbairner october 2013key player grades franck ribery a julian finney getty images frances main man on the night was ribery central to everything his goal and assist for benzemas third demonstrated his individual importance to the side on this sort of form you will be left wondering what else the 30yearold has to do in order to win the fifa ballon dor if he does not sweep the gong this year for helping les bleus to qualification while his teammates took their foot off the gas after the opening goal ribery was constantly probing for openings and looking every bit the talisman that he has become for france recently his opening goal was nothing short of sensational ribery at his best losing his men before driving home from outside of the area to immediately put the hosts onto the front foot julian finney getty images mathieu debuchy aa surprise nomination in the top three players from the match but it is deserved as debuchy was massively impressive for france given his chance against both australia and finland due to bacary sagnas injury the newcastle united man has impressed with two good performances a constant menace from right back debuchys speed and work rate on the flank created problems for the finns not only was his linkup play with samir nasri mathieu valbuena and ribery encouraging he also found himself in some dangerous positions in front of goal debuchys most telling contribution though was his cross that created the second goal a beautiful deep ball into the box that giroud knocked goalwards with a towering header that toivio could only send into his own net he almost added a second assist minutes later with a second cross but loic remys header came back off the post julian finney getty images olivier giroud b three goals in two games for giroud in this recent international break caps an impressive contribution from the arsenal man the 27yearold did not get the same service he enjoyed against australia but he still made a nuisance of himself in the finland defence girouds goal was well taken but his target man performance will have perhaps been more encouraging to deschamps it was by no means a vintage showing but the former montpellier man was functional and provided the physical presence that enabled ribery in particular to thrive honorable mentions julian finney getty images karim benzemas goal deserves individual mention although he was only on the pitch for a short space of time the real madrid man made the most of his limited opportunity following a goal scoring substitute appearance against australia benzema did exactly the same against finland although the finish was of a higher class riberys assist may have been sensational but the movement required of benzema to be in a position to score from was also impressive his celebration after a lovely hooked finish demonstrates the confidence beginning to flow within the out of favour real madrid striker once again b e n z e m a does a bit of shadow boxing to the crowd after scoring to make it after more superb work from ribery jerome pugmire jeromepugmire october 2013although there was little for finland to cheer on the night the result belied a few individual performances kasper hamalainen looked excellent and was a constant source of trouble for france roman eremenko also posed the hosts some difficulties and stood out in an otherwise mediocre

ready to go against kazakhstan while oshea was returning from a onematch suspension keane has undergone much criticism during his countrys failed world cup bid but looked in fine form on tuesday evening aleksandr kislitsyn committed a foul in the box in the 16th minute allowing keane to score his 61st international goal by foolingkazakhstan goalkeeperandrey sidelnikov on a penalty to knot the

unleashed a wellstruck ball past the irish defense and into the back of the net seamus coleman had helped set up the goal with a misplaced clearance attempt that sent a spell of silence over the crowd kazakhstan who are also out of world cup contention seemingly had all the momentum at that point they were ahead early on a reeling irish side who had sackedgiovannitrapattonijust last month but shomkos goal would be the only time kazakhstan held any semblance of the momentum jamie mcdonald getty images the irish side looked rejuvenated under king who is holding fort until a permanent replacement can be named they controlled possession from the outset working the ball around the perimeter of the kazakhstan defense and waiting for their perfect time to strike holding for just under threequarters of the match ireland were able to hold off the visiting side and prevent them from even getting the ball past midfield for much of the match oshea capitalized on thekazakhs inability to properly clear in the 26th minute he knocked through a rebound attempt afterrichard dunne nearly scored on a failed cornerkick clearance it was the second goal of the sunderland defenders international career in caps with the score in their favor ireland worked hard to hold possession and avoid any costly mistakes and for the most part they succeeded david forde faced only two shots on goal as the irish defense did an excellent job of blocking attempts deep in the zone and forcing mistakes by pressuring the ball jamie mcdonald getty images on the rare instances wherekazakhstanwere able to get a clear attempt they went nowhere after shomkos early score in fact the kazakh midfielder even gave one back to his opponents scoring an own goal after a dashing run into the middle by

3 arsenal supporters got about the worst news possible as mesut ozil limped off in germanys world cup qualifier the midfielder was substituted in the 82nd minute and immediately went back to the dressing room rather than the bench per swiss ramble on twitter ozil substituted hate to say it but he walked straight to the dressing room with a slight limp swiss ramble swissramble october 2013the good news is that ozil didnt have to be stretchered off thats when you get worried as a supporter because thats one of the telltale signs of a longterm problem at the very least he was able to walk off the pitch on his own power so the severity of the injury may not be serious however any sort of injury problem could potentially be a major blow for arsenal since ozil is one of the biggest reasons they are top of the league table since moving from real madrid the 25yearold has been one of the gunners best players in four premier league appearances hes had three assists and hes also tallied a goal and an assist in two champions league appearances losing one of your best players could end up in dropping points that prove the difference between first and second at the end of the season
3 pittsburgh steelers players better not get too comfortable with anything they might find fun or entertaining because head coach mike tomlin might just up and ban it losing isnt fun a sentiment shared by any team going through tough times however tomlin seems determined to take all the fun out of the steelers current campaign cbs sports ryan wilson spotted this tweet from mike prisuta quoting the coach from tuesdays press conference no more flying leaps and flips into the end zone for steelers tomlin that would be very correct its a potential for injury its silly mike prisuta dvemike october 2013if you are scoring at home tomlin isnt a fan of the sillinessat least not this season joe camporealeusa today sports if you recall the pittsburgh postgazette reported back on october that tomlin decided to ban games like ping pong andshuffleboard in the locker room nfl coms chris wesseling reports veterans initially started that ban for all players with less than four years of service eventually tomlin tired of theseparationcaused amid players and just up and banned everyone from playing games ryan clark stated at the time from his point it was dividing the team in a way the safety continued one sect of people couldnt do a certain thing and he just wanted everybody to be togetherbecause were all in the losses together now it has to be stated that nobody has any fun when the team loses athletes are just like we nonathletes they have stressful days at the office and like to blow off steam however its clear tomlin wants to set an example that more than letting loose and relieving stress the team needs to come together and win as for the ban on touchdown flipping we arent about to chide coach for making a call that is certainly his to make if he thinks it will save the team from some dumb injury down the road more power to him there certainly needs to be a ban on kickers celebrating to keep them from hurting themselves normally this is the point that we would lambaste the league for again proving to be no fun but this is a coach trying his best to set the tone for some semblance of a revitalized season we tip our hats and tell you steelers to keep the touchdowns coming but refrain from somersaulting into the end zone just know that the steelers may be heading into their week clash with the baltimore ravens but they are all business from here on out unless business becomes fun and then tomlin might ban that too hit me up on twitter follow gabezal

2 london there were scaresthis is england of course there were scaresbut on tuesday england duly went out and grabbed the prize that was on offer a place at the world cup a win never felt comfortable but was certainly warranted by the manner of the performance the three lions looking uncharacteristically inventive and incisive in attack for a second game in five days as they defeated poland at wembley wayne rooney decided to go without his protective headband for five minutes towards the end of the first half and in that time scored the allimportant goal rising at the far post to head leighton baines pinpoint cross into the bottom corner then with five arduous minutes remaining steven gerrard seemed to summon his last burst of energy to stumble into the box and flick a stretching effort over the goalkeeper eventually belatedly sending england to the world cup after fridays win over montenegro roy hodgson promised that his players were aware that it was only a job half done and with the relative safety net of a playoff awaiting anything less than a win attacked with purpose almost from the off after getting a lucky break when robert lewandowskiwhose presence on the opposite side may have seen the scoreline somewhat more emphaticslid wide when clean through on goal with the scoreline still england grew in stature and dominated the contest andros townsend rattled the crossbar with a brilliant curling effort while the two daniels sturridge and welbeck both saw good opportunities fended off by the overworked wojciech szczesny laurence griffiths getty images it was the most unimpressive of englands attackers who broke the deadlock however rooney had seen little of the ball before his crucial interventionanticipating another perfect baines cross it was about the fourth of the everton left backs night to glance it home with the lead established england bounced off at halftime on friday the three lions had emerged after halftime with a renewed purpose scoring the first goal of the games just three minutes after the restart on this occasion however it was polandperhaps inspired by the officially reported although it felt more like inside the stadium fans there to support themwho started stronger building on one of the last acts of the first half that saw waldemar sobota have a goal disallowed correctly for offside poland probed but the underpressure joe hart dealt with whatever came his way highlighted by a fine save to deny lewandowski as the borussia dortmund player tried to lift it over him then play was stopped by a pitch invader emanating from the poland end a delay that seemed to do more to upset the visitors than inspire them england grew in confidence gary cahill being denied from a corner by szczesny before the arsenal man did the same with a rooney effort from range hodgson responded by withdrawing michael carrickenglands leader in both passes made and completion percentagefor frank lampard a questionable move especially when lampards first real involvement minutes later saw him booked for a needless foul on polands own substitute slawomir peszko england needed a second goal to ease the nerves but szczesny continued to impressdenying sturridge after another rasping effort as it was every poland counterattack seemed extrathreatening rooney following lampard into the referees notebook with a particularly agricultural challenge to end one such move mike hewitt getty images when sturridge was withdrawn for jack wilshere with minutes remaining hodgsons plan became cleartry to retain possession preserving the slender advantage rather than looking to double it it was a plan fraught with risk but perhaps the only one available to him as almost all englands attackminded players looked fatigued after nearly minutes of highstakes football even townsend englands wild card against montenegro declined opportunities to run at his opposition man making it unsurprising when he was the final man sacrificed for the oftmaligned james milner with no one else stepping up to protect englands fans from having to squirm through a nervous final few minutes captain steven gerrard decided to do it himself bursting through the defence gerrard lifted the ball over the onrushing szczesny to seal a winand send england to brazil two mustwin games two wins england are going to the party and hodgson now has eight months to plan for it follow alexdimond
4 the miami heat still havent finished their championship celebration sure the victory parade and comped nightclub bash are both distant memories but the banner raising and ring ceremony have yet to commence both of those events are slated for oct which not coincidentally happens to coincide with the teams first meeting against its biggest threat in its bid for a threepeatthe chicago bulls after agonizing months chicago will finally see the return of former mvp derrick rose his presence coupled with external additions and internal improvements will fuel the windy citys rise up the nba pecking order so much has changed since the last time the basketball world saw rose in regularseason action but really so many things have stayed the same the thorn in miamis side starts and stops with chicagos sweetest flower order restored gary dineen getty images even without rose who missed the entire campaign while recovering from a torn acl the bulls remained surprisingly potent last season bolstered by their stifling defense defensive rating sixth best in the nba chicago rattled off regularseason wins the bulls played games of postseason basketball which included a grueling sevengame defeat of the brooklyn nets and a heroic game road upset of the eventual champion heat in the eastern conference semifinals but this wasnt the chicago team fans were used to seeing with a healthy rose the bulls won a leaguebest games in then tallied a conferenceleading victories in the strikeshortened campaign roses bulls were one of those rare teams that could win with its offense or its defense in chicago posted the nbas best defensive rating and finished 11th in offensive rating the following season chicago moved into the top five in both those categories second and fifth respectively only five other teams have managed topfive finishes in offensive and defensive ratings in the last five seasons that group includes one nba champion los angeles lakers an nba finalist heat and two conference finalists orlando magic in cleveland cavaliers in the two teams not to make prolonged playoff runs were both derailed by injury the bulls in roses acl and the oklahoma city thunder last season russell westbrooks torn meniscus ron hoskins getty images with rose back at the helm fans can expect chicago to return to being a topfive defense remember this is largely the same group that posted that no ranking last season only now the bulls will have the supercharged rose defending the point instead of the oftinjured kirk hinrich and the absentminded nate robinson but the ceiling for chicagos offense rises even higher joakim noah rewrote his offensive scouting report last season with career highs in scoring assists and usage rate percent jimmy butlers breakout was even more dramatic as the sophomore shattered the marks of his rookie year points true shooting percentage and player efficiency rating up from and respectively then theres the offseason arrival of sniper mike dunleavy the 11year veteran brings a career threepoint percentage to the windy city and comes fresh off a careerbest percent showing from deep for the milwaukee bucks last season and then of course theres rose a player so freakishly gifted on offense hes reached mythical status after just four mostly healthy nba seasons hidden in plain sight jared wickerham getty images fortunes were changed this summer the houston rockets netted the biggest freeagent fish in threetime defensive player of the year dwight howard the golden state warriors looked to build on their western conference semifinals run last season with the arrival of versatile wing man andre iguodala the detroit pistons josh smith brandon jennings and the new orleans pelicans tyreke evans made their own swings for the fences but the bulls are the real offseason winners with chicagos native son setting a new standard for summertime additions players like rose dont enter the freeagency sweepstakes wildly productive and fiercely loyal his worth is limited only by the stipulations set forth in the leagues collective bargaining agreement hes been a superstar since he first stepped foot on the nba hardwood back in he was the rookie of the year in and two seasons later became the youngest mvp in nba history nathaniel s butler getty images the bulls proved last season they dont need rose for the team to be a defensive power credit the shrewd teaching of tom thibodeau and the relentless efforts of players like butler noah and luol deng for that but when facing a fellow defensive juggernaut like miami defensive rating last season ninth best chicago has to offset the heats energetic defense with offensive execution thats where roses natural gifts take over since his arrival into the nba rose has garnered the bulls an extra points per possessions when hes on the floor and he doesnt simply add baskets he improves this efficiency of the players around him those numbers are meaningless without context heres exactly what roses presence means that offensive rating would have ranked as the seventhbest mark in the league last season at chicago would have been no that percent drop in effective fieldgoal percentage would have represented a sevenspot drop from no to no and even these numbers are skewed by the inclusion of roses first two seasons when he was still learning how to be an nba point guard over the course of his four healthy seasons hes added more than points to his assist percentage up from and seven to his player efficiency rating up from hes trimmed his turnover rate down from while seeing a dramatic increase in his usage up from armed with an improved jump shot a strengthened supporting cast and somehow even more hops rose is poised to lead his city to basketball greatness if you think that will cause him to ease up on the gas pedal well you should probably think again derrick i dont care if its my mom on the court shes going to get killed aggrey sam csnbullsinsider october 2013heat nation its time to take note of these bulls i guarantee you that miamis players already have clearing the championship path mike ehrmann getty images until proven otherwise all title roads run through south beach take the best player on the planet lebron james surround him with a pair of allstars dwyane wade and chris bosh and a horde of spacers and you have the ingredients of a championship recipe its worked for the heat in each of the last two seasons but has placed a gigantic target on their back in the process a cluttered championship field awaits miami in its quest to threepeat but its time to start unscrambling that crowd some championship hopefuls still dont have enough pieces to compete sorry warriors rockets memphis grizzlies and new york knicks fans others will fall victim to father time brooklyn nets san antonio spurs the next dominant team that blake griffinor chris paul for that matterplays for will be the first so the los angeles clippers are out the oklahoma city thunder had their shot at miami and may never get another chance without successfully replacing james harden that leaves two teams standing in miamis way the bulls and the indiana pacers indiana dramatically improved last seasons 49win team the pacers bolstered their bench luis scola chris copeland c j watson and solomon hill and are returning their own wounded

3 if youre one of those people who says injuries arent an excuse because everybody has them we cant be friends its nothing personal its just that im already friends with logic and you guys dont get along yes everybody has injuries but some teams suffer from more than others do some lose handfuls of starters while others lose mere role players or reserves some get hit early and recover and some get hit during the home stretch it all matters injuries derail seasons every single year and thatll never change you cant usually blame all of your struggles on injury luck but it is certainly a major factor in all major professional sports lately it has certainly been a major factor for the dallas cowboys according to rick gosselin of thedallas morning news the cowboys lost more games to injury than all but two other nfl teams in applying a more sophisticated formula that takes the importance of injured players into account football outsiders concluded that the cowboys were the fifthmostinjured team in football last season nfls most injured teams teamstarter games lost rank adjusted games lost rank green bay packers83 108 washington redskins75 89 dallas cowboys71 86 jacksonville jaguars69 99 indianapolis colts66 92 football outsiders dallas morning newsnow an important caveat the two teams gosselin listed as more injured than the cowboys last yeargreen bay and washingtonboth made the playoffs the formula used by football outsiders also concluded that indianapolis and jacksonville were hit harder by injuries than dallas with the colts making the playoffs so again injuries can be overcome however circumstances change from roster to roster when you dig a little deeper its easier to see why dallas had so much trouble in the problem is that the cowboys were hit so damn hard in one area according to football outsiders only the packers and detroit lions had more adjusted games lost agl on the defensive side of the ball green bay was able to survive with that highpowered offense and the highestrated quarterback in nfl history the cowboys werent able to overcome the losses of sean lee bruce carter jay ratliff and barry church on defense indy and washingtons injuries were more balanced neither ranked in the bottom five in terms of agl on either offense or defense which certainly had to make things a little easier throw in that the colts who actually won the afc south despite surrendering more points than they scored had the leagues thirdeasiest scheduleand its easier to argue that the cowboys had very bad luck with injuries last season now here we are six weeks into the campaign and the boys are preparing to play the division rival philadelphia eagles without their top two passrushers and three of their starting four defensive linemen anthony spencer who pro football focus subscription required graded as the best outside linebacker in football last year is on injured reserve and it looks like ratliff could soon be joining him there thats a lot of adjusted games lost but the alarm didnt really start to sound until demarcus ware and demarco murray were both injured on sunday night adam schefter and todd archer of espn com reported that both will likely miss some time which is terrifying its terrifying because ware is the best defensive player in this division and his injury indicates that the cowboys are being hit hard in one spot yet again its even more terrifying because the offense has typically lost balance when the dangerous murray is removed from the backfield dallas cowboys injured starters playerpositioninjurystatusanthony spencerdekneeinjured reservejay ratliffdtgroinpup listdemarcus waredequad34 weeksdemarco murrayrbkneeweektoweekmiles austinwrhamstringjust returnedrotoworldwithout murray who now has a sprained left mcl the cowboys arent themselves on offense phillip tanner is unreliable lance dunbar is hurtandunreliable and joseph randle is a rookie whos averaging just yards per carry during the six games murray missed last season dallas averaged only yards per play with him in the lineup that total shot up to not bad considering that the oklahoma product didnt even have a particularly good season we cant use history to forecast how the cowboys might perform without ware who suffered a strain to his right quadriceps while trying to get to robert griffin iii in the second quarter on sunday because this will be the first time theyve been without him since he was playing college ball at troy in will injuries cost dallas a playoff spot in yesnosubmit votevote to see resultswill injuries cost dallas a playoff spot in yes0 no100 total votes if br polldata br polldata if br polldata br polldata id question will injuries cost dallas a playoff spot in choices choice0 count choice yes choice6 count choice choice1 count choice no choice7 count choice choice2 count choice choice8 count choice choice3 count choice choice9 count choice choice4 count choice choice5 count choice sidebar false if br poll br poll showresults false

3 the new york giants are not purposefully attempting to tank though with countless injuries sustained and unlikely names brought in on a weekly basis what may soon be an incidental season is indiscernible from a more calculated failure on monday rookie michael cox was the lonesome giants running back at practice and should he remain healthy until sunday seriously knock on wood will be the starter in the backfield against the visiting minnesota vikings hes young tom coughlin vaguely told the new york times on monday he obviously has a lot going and there are some things right now we feel good about there isnt much to feel good about in new york as it has been more of a sketch comedy than a season thus far for big blue eli mannings first pass was picked off by a defensive lineman no receiver hakeem nicks complained like gisele bundchen brandon jacobs tweeted the front office for his old job and the giants quickly became a winless defunct and dormant team the giants and the rookie cox have something in common new york is a few short weeks from being utterly irrelevant in the nfl season and cox was just one pick from being mr irrelevant in the draft selected 253rd overall in the seventh round denny medleyusa today sports the 24yearold will make his first nfl start under a lot of responsibility cox is a 220pound 24yearold boston mass native who was a youth hockey standout in the professional pipeline of the northeast he attended avon old farms a boarding school in connecticut for the hockey program he didnt take his first snap until high school but quickly found success wearing cleats instead of blades and became a solid recruit he decided to play football for the michigan wolverines where he redshirted in failed to win the starting role the following three seasons and graduated with another year of eligibility he traveled back home to the umass minutemen for the season playing in all games he compiled yards on carries for a 7yard average and five touchdowns in his final collegiate year his one 100plus rushing performance was against miami of ohio in which he picked up yards on attempts for two scores in the giants preseason cox had carries for yards and three receptions for yards but his dimensions his unorthodox past and his slightly hollow stat lines hardly matter at this point cox is the fifth and only remaining option andre brown broke his left leg for the second straight year in preseason david wilson is currently sidelined with a neck injury darel scott was waived after week resigned after wilsons injury and strained his hamstring against the chicago bears brandon jacobs who finally brought a glimmer of hope to the giants backfield with yards and two trips to the end zone on thursday picked up a hamstring injury as well mike dinovousa today sports brandon jacobs celebrates one of his two td against the bears thursday night cox told thenew york times it was a little strange being the only one out there for practice but i feel like im ready to go they said im going to be playing there is no question of the rookies talent but there are of course reservations about his readiness since he is making his first appearance in week the giants will be concerned about his ability to make correct reads of defensive packages and learn the intricacies of his own teams offensive schemes robert deutschusa today cox must prove himself able to pass protect for eli manning the most glaring and obvious apprehension is about coxs pass protection though and his most important test will be in keeping manning healthy not in moving the chains cox toldpennington after practice theres a lot to understand you have to read the defensive fronts linebackers and secondary almost like a quarterback one way to help himself as painful as it may sound is to study as much tape of the giants first six weeks as possible he said to the associated press via cbsnewyork i feel like im ready to go but obviously im just working on everything pass protection just watching more film and the whole offense everything if giants fans are looking for a hint of optimism heading into sunday the official team website offers a favorable scouting description of cox referring to him as a punishing blocker who has excellent leg driveto get the tough yardage running between the tackles according to the same report he first demonstrated himself as an athletic specimen at the super regional combine in dallas where he opened the eyes of nfl decision makers running a 58second 40yard dash with reps in the 225pound bench press followed by a 41inch vertical jump and a broad jump brad pennerusa today sports cox shows off his speed in giants training camp the giants do have the wrecking ball 245pound fullback john conner though all signs point to cox as the primary back against minnesota the 31yearold jacobs on the other hand wanted to remind reporters that he not only will be suited up to help contribute for sundays game but also that it was the trainers decisionnot his ownto miss mondays practice im not missing any game thursdays offensive leader told the ap straight up thats all there is in a nutshell i am not counting on being down there is not much to joke about for the giants as the postseason door continues to close on a dreadful year there may be even less rhyme or reason for tom coughlins frivolity when asked about the lack of halfbacks on the practice field however the twotime super bowlwinning coach retorted what do you mean we had one were all set
3 myers has failed to catch a single ball in two of the last three games for the giants thus despite a favorable matchup with the struggling minnesota defense myers isnt a recommended option at tight end myers was supposed to make life easier for quarterback eli manning but that has not materialized so far in myers tipped a pass last week against the bears that resulted in an interception and secured the win for chicago though the pass could have been better its clear myers is not on the same page as his quarterback

3 nicks has been mentioned in trade rumors this week due to the giants start and the fact that he is a free agent after this season that shouldnt affect his performance monday night against the vikings however minnesota is allowing passing yards per game in nicks has yet to find the end zone this season but has churned up the yardage he is managing almost yards receiving per game the emergence of reuben randle has caused his stock to take a hit in and is another reason for the trade rumors nevertheless assuming he suits up for the giants on monday nicks should be able to make an impact
3 randle has been the most productive receiver for the giants over the past two games a trend which figures to continue against the porous minnesota vikings secondary minnesota is giving up passing yards per game randle has been targeted times over his last two contests showing he is slowly gaining quarterback eli mannings trust randle has responded with nine catches for yards and three touchdowns over that span the vikings are near the bottom in passing defense statistics making randle a stellar play this week on monday night football

3 cincinnati bengals quarterback andy dalton has one of the best supporting casts in all the nfl among them are a bestintheleague offensive line a trio of wide receivers that includes playmaker a j green physical possession receiver mohamed sanu and the fast marvin jones a pair of receiving tight ends and a running back tandem featuring bruiser benjarvus greenellis and the shifty giovani bernard any quarterback would easily feel like a kid in a candy store if they had the weapons at daltons disposal the bengals have benefited greatly from their offense so far this season with a record and the hardfought sole possession of the afc norths top spot dalton is playing well which makes sense considering the talent around him hes completed of his pass attempts65 percentfor yards eight touchdowns and six interceptions while he has been sacked times and his receiving targets have dropped passes hes on pace to have the best season of his career but one area in which he hasnt improved much from to now is the deep passing game andy dalton on passes of yards yearatt comp yardstdsintsdeep acc 201160289227511 46 201267185804512 32 20132592724011 36 via pro football focus subscription required last season dalton attempted deep passesthose of or more yardsand completed only of them netting the bengals yards four touchdowns and five interceptions according to pro football focus subscription required just percent of daltons passes were deep throws and his accuracy percentage of ranked him 27th out of quarterbacks so far this year dalton has attempted only passes of or more yards with nine completions for yards four touchdowns and no interceptions hes now throwing deep just on percent of his attempts though his accuracy percentage has risen from to percent dalton has shown slight improvement but it hasnt resulted in more deep shots its not as though dalton cant make the throwshis drastically increased yards per attempt which average presently up from last year and his rookie season indicates that any worries about his arm strength are unfounded and its not as though he lacks a deepthreat receiverboth green and sanu are highly talented in this area so what gives dalton attempted only three deep passes in week against the bills connecting on one—this a j green touchdown the only possible explanation is the play calling either head coach marvin lewis and offensive coordinator jay gruden dont want dalton going for the homerun play all that often they arent confident that he can do so with consistent success or they see the speed of their receivers and choose to let them do the work on the ground rather than have dalton do it all through the air looking at daltons passesbydirection through six games this year and its clear where the bengals want most of their passes to be thrownfrom behind the line of scrimmage to nine yards beyond it of daltons pass attempts have come at this distance accounting for of his completions the cincinnati passing game seems to be more reliant on yards after the catch and not the depth of the pass bengals yac numbers for yardsyacgreen464139sanu218156jones19073sanzenbacher2912eifert225124gresham210158bernard201204greenellis92via pro football focus subscription required of greens receiving yards are yards after the catch sanu has receiving yards of those coming after the catch of jones receiving yards have come after the catch rookie tyler eifert has receiving yards of which have come after the catch and of fellow tight end jermaine greshams yards are after the catch even dane sanzenbacher has gotten much of his yardage after the catch12 of yards the bengals are relying on the screen game so that dalton can get the ball out quickly this keeps him from reading his progressions however which leaves deep threats like green stranded even in coverage situations that lean in their favor and as the cincinnati enquirers paul daugherty points out as soon as defenses realize that dalton wont be throwing deep those screens wont yield the yardage they are now opposing defenses will crowd their safeties closer to the line of scrimmage and the yards after the catch numbers will drop dalton must air out the ball more often whether on his own accord or at the behest of his coaches dalton had only three attempts of or more yards in the bengals overtime win over the buffalo bills in week and just one completion to green which resulted in a touchdown dalton attempted passes in the game and yet only three were thrown deep for a quarterback with so many weapons especially ones like green sanu and jones who can get separation from defenders and handle deep passing its confounding to see so few attempts jason miller getty images andy dalton is more than just a screenthrowing game manager hes just not being asked to air it out unlike last year dalton hasnt thrown a single interception on his deep passes none of the deep passes hes thrown this year have even been dropped hes shown signs of improvement in this area but yet hes not getting many more opportunities at the deep pass than last year while the yards after the catch being put up by his receivers are working for now they eventually wont as long as dalton ceases to be a deep threat daltons overall accuracy is much better than the previous two years hes currently 11th in the league in accuracy percentage at compared to 19th last year at percent and 20th in his rookie year at percent the perception that dalton is somehow a problem or not progressing is just thata perception and mostly a wrong one its more that hes been given fewer opportunities to show off his improved downfield passing now hes coming off as a weakarmed game manager when he could beand ismuch more by holding dalton back the bengals are ultimately holding down their entire offense yes the bengals receivers success at making plays in space has paid off thus far but theres no sense in avoiding deep passing when there are receivers able to catch those passes and a quarterback capable of throwing them
3 brown has been lackluster as a fantasy kicker this season but his luck could be changing as the giants host the minnesota vikings on monday night football the vikings are allowing the thirdmost points in the league in giving up points per tilt the giants are deadleast in terms of points allowed meaning that this game has all the makings of a shootout the giants offense has also looked better of late despite the continued struggles of quarterback eli manning the giants have scored points in each of the past two games brown could be in line for a breakout performance

4 no nba season would be complete without rumors of the los angeles lakers shopping pau gasol so color the campaign complete according to fox sports ohios sam amico the lakers are reportedly open to dealing gasol before the regular season begins he writes that los angeles may look to make a substantial trade in the near future and that gasol is far from untouchable just for kicks read that one more time while listening to this in the background gasol has spent the better part of the last three years on the block and hes yet to be moved the closest the lakers came was in when david stern prevented them from acquiring chris paul from the then new orleans hornets circumstances have changed in the land of make believe since then gasol is no longer expendable as espn los angeles ramona shelburne pointed out hes important to what the lakers are building both now and later lakers insist paugasol is still very much their guy for this year see him as a key for them this year ramona shelburne ramonashelburne october 2013 cliprkid paugasol no reason to trade him now both sides need him to play well this year ramona shelburne ramonashelburne october 2013change is a fluid concept in the association so theres no guarantee the lakers are humming the same song tomorrow but general manager mitch kupchak and co are smart enough to know when to hold em and when to fold em meaning they should understand theres little to gain by ditching gasol now who ya gonna get andrew d bernstein getty images trading gasol would be like trading kobe bryant lakers fans wouldnt be as enraged but financially the plausible scenarios dont align with what the teams goals would be in any deal gasols expiring pact like kobes is that massive the bouncyhaired spaniard is slated to make million this season los angeles could attempt to move him for any number of reasons none of which will make sense in the long run saving money could be reason numero uno shedding gasols million salary puts the lakers under the luxury tax threshold in theory andrew d bernstein getty images what kind of package does la expect to get los angeles will have to take someone s back to make the finances match up his salary wont just magically disappear from their books few teams in the nba are prepared to make that kind of financial commitment without sending back ample salary theres no such thing as a clean break here of course the lakers could merely be concerned with getting worse in anticipation of the draft in which case the caliber of talent they receive wont be a sticking point but even that logic is flawed expiring contracts totaling 10plus million dont grow on trees unless the utah jazz roll up with an offer of andris biedrins million and richard jefferson million or marvin williams million the lakers will be hardpressed to find organizations with the necessary contracts to make it work any deal the lakers make involving anyone from now until has to be with lebron james and carmelo anthony among others in mind they cant take on any longterm salary if they wish to peruse the shelves of toptier free agents expected to be available next summer nathaniel s butler getty images los angeles cant jeopardize its spending power in putting themselves in position to land two stars in addition to resigning kobe is going to be difficult as it is and thats with the lakers having just two players under contract next season steve nash and robert sacre taking on more salary past this year impedes their pursuits even further theres always the potential for the lakers not to care though in the unlikely event they find out lebron is prepared to opt in for one more year with the miami heat or more likely if they express a desire to flip gasol for an alist player they could hit the trade market looking for something substantial in return though that sounds great such thinking presents issues of its own gasol is coming off his worstever nba season during which he averaged a career worst in points and fieldgoal percentage and played in a careerlow games receiving adequate talent in return will be impossible even for teams sold on him having a bounceback campaign the lakers value him more than any interested suitor would john e sokolowskiusa today spo there are no kevin loves to be had in exchange for gasol either his expiring deal complicates things too prospective courters wont fork over valuable assets if they arent assured gasol will resign over the offseason assuming the lakers overcome all these obstacles assuming they find an interested suitor who doesnt care about gasols health or age whats to gain lapsing contracts that help them tank middling talent on longterm deals no thanks ill pass there is no kevin love to be had for gasol id be surprised if the milwaukee bucks in all their confounded glory were willing to put together a package built around john henson and ersan ilyasova among others unless the lakers suddenly plan to tank see the jazz trade dealing their big man isnt worth the headaches such discussions would incite or the return theyll be able to net the kobe bryant factorgasol isnt dwight howard meaning kobe doesnt want to tear him limb from limb unfollow him on twitter or fill his locker with an active beehive talk of trading pau has not sat well with kobe in the past trading gasol isnt going to sit well with the black mamba whom we know the lakers are still intent on keeping happy mere discussions of dealing gasol havent jibed with kobe in the past and thats not going to change now after howard left kobe made it clear that he and gasol were in this together see the picture above what kind of message is that sending if the lakers unload one of his most trusted companions los angeles has already gone against kobes wishes once this offseason he wanted to keep the core intactwhich would have meant retaining metta world peaceand make another run at a title but the lakers amnestied world peace anyway opting for the million in savings from luxury taxes and salary personally id keep metta and make a run with the unit we have and just add a few pieces keepthepeace lakersstilldeciding kobe bryant kobebryant july 2013moving gasol next suggests the lakers arent committed to winning this season while acceptable to fans of andrew wiggins kobe isnt one to tolerate an aversion to winning in the hear and now doesnt matter if the team has no chance of winning the title kobe is a competitor and whatever move the lakers make pertaining to gasol it wont be one that boosts their ability to compete again the lakers arent going to pull the trigger on a deal that jeopardizes their spending potential next summer when lebron melo and others could be available nor should they any return theyre bound to negotiate then will consist of expiring contracts and most likely players not suited to spark a playoff run were word to come out that kobe would miss all or most of the season because of complications in his achilles recovery then tanking becomes acceptable kobe still wont be happy but he can only gripe so much from the sidelines neither hollywood nor kobe has reached that point returning on opening night has basically been ruled out but hes going to come back asked if theres a chance kobe plays oct opener dantoni said no i don’t think so it’s an ongoing process but that would be tough ” kevin ding kevinding october 2013when he does return the lakers would be wise to have a team worthy of playoff contention waiting for him a team gasol is still a part of ripple effects now and later andrew d bernstein getty images pau can help the lakers move on from dwight if the lakers want to make the playoffs they need gasol end of story and all indications are they want to make the playoffs aside from placating the mambas innate desire to win theres a need for this team to move on from last season trading gasolor rather knowingly damaging the ceiling of this teamisnt going to help the lakers move on all its going to do is irritate kobe and allow howard to become the missing link think about that not everyone will see this move as the lakers planning for the future no matter what they do howard leaves and suddenly the lakers disband their team the incensed headlines will write themselves with gasol and a healthy kobe the lakers have the potential to distance themselves from last year coach mike dantoni can ask who of superman and really mean it they cant pass up that opportunity not after the depreciation that last season inflicted on their blueprint mike dantoni answered a question about the lakers moving on without dwighthoward with a single word who kevin ding kevinding october 2013los angeles has to think bigger picture here as well peddling gasol across the league like a knifeandfork salesman may seem like a good idea for a lakers team trying to buy losses but they shouldnt be trying to buy losses and the lakers may need gasol beyond next season kirby leeusa today sports keeping gasol increases the chances he and kobe take a pay cut to stay next summer deliberately fielding a lotterybound unit doesnt always pay off michael jordan and the charlotte bobcats would attest to that more pressingly selling lebron and whoever else the lakers chase on a gutted roster coming off a losing season has the word failure written all over it gasol says he wont take a pay cut to stay with the lakers after this season but he could change his tune just like kobe might staring at a team prepared to add another superstar or two he and kobe could stay along for the ride at a discount and chase more championships however unlikely it seems that gasol would take less to stay in los angeles any chance of it happening vanishes if he is traded hes not going to give consideration let alone special discounts to a team that repeatedly shopped him then ultimately traded him when they needed him going nowhere probably ethan miller getty images tanking thats why the

3 do not get it twisted mack brown is responsible for restoring a once struggling texas football program to its place as a college football powerhouse but in the whathaveyoudone for me lately culture of college football the longhorns rose bowl appearance feels like ancient history after a remarkable run between and brown and the longhorns have fallen on hard times two embarrassing early losses the firing of defensive coordinator manny diaz and the announcement of texas athletic director deloss dodds retirement has turned browns job status into a weektoweek soap opera with the media and the fans waiting for the hammer to drop on one of the winningest active fbs coaches in college football history then saturdays upset over no oklahoma looked like a new beginning for texas but it could very likely be browns red river encore and the beginning of the end of the 16year career at texas for mack brown one of the premier and most significant coaches in texas longhorns history bringing tradition back to the 40acresprior to browns arrival the texas longhorns had an 11year record of under head coaches david mcwilliams and john mackovic after mackovic finished the season with a recordone of the longhorns worst records in five decadestexas athletic director deloss dodds made a decision that would change the entire landscape of texas football dodds hired mack brown fresh off an season at north carolina as the texas longhorns head coach on december 4th brown went straight to work hiring a staff of veteran assistant coaches reuniting with the texas lettermen and most importantly rekindling the relationship with texas high school football coaches i have never seen anyone make friends better or quicker with the high school coaching community eddie joseph former vp of the texas high school coaches association said mack is amazing but browns offthefield pr was only a fraction of what he brought to texas the season did not start the way brown may have envisioned the longhorns were and texas fans questioned if dodds made the right hire eddie joseph told me i couldnt find enough friends to be pall bearers at my funeral brown said of his start in texas fought through the start to finish the season with a cotton bowl win over mississippi state the longhorns second bowl win in a decade brown also had the opportunity to coach the longhorns second heisman trophy winner ricky williams despite williams initial hesitance i didnt really like him ricky williams told the waco tribune i was partial to john mackovic and texas had fired mackovic i had pretty much made up my mind after my first conversation with brown that i was leaving but then we talked again and the way he responded really caught my attention and made an impression on me it opened the door for me to come back my senior year in their first conversation brown informed williams of his hair policy which conflicted with williams signature dreadlocks i sincerely think if we had told ricky you have to give up your hair style to stay here he would have gone to the nfl brown said in steve richardsons book ricky williams dreadlocks to ditka but browns wife sally came to the rescue and reportedly convinced her husband to ease up on his hair style policy according to chip brown of orangebloods com williams decision to stay for his senior year was the first sign of browns success at texas and williams yards rushing and touchdowns in his heisman season was the pictureperfect beginning to browns legendary career coach brown has instilled a new kind of attitude in this team its not just being aggressive its about initiating a whole team philosophy weve had a lot of oneness on this team in the past but now were picking each other off the ground giving each other high fives something ive never seen before in the five years that ive been here ben adams texas offensive guard via ricky williams dreadlocks to ditka by steve richardson charisma and enthusiasm had not been seen at texas since the darrell royal glory yearsmore than two decades prior to browns hiring but browns personality and ability to turn around a program immediately influenced both longhorn players and texas fans brown helped bring pride back to the once divided texas fan base in his first three seasons texas upped its seasonticket base by more than according to texassports com browns success both on and off the field quickly captured the attention of the nation the journey to the topthe season was the first time the longhorns finished with top ap ranking and wins since it would not be the last mack browns fourth season at texas sparked the beginning of what would be a magical run of ninestraight doubledigit win seasons complete with multiple bcs bowl berths and two national championship appearances but one of the most important wins came off the field after the season when he signed madison high school quarterback and the rivals com no overall prospect vince young youngs talent was not fully witnessed until when he led the longhorns to an record with six comefrombehind victories including an epic last second win over michigan in the rose bowl following the longhorns rose bowl win young gave an early prediction of the longhorns fate the following season well be back young said when asked if texas will make a second appearance in the bcs national championship the next season in the rose bowl and he was right 2005 was a fairytale season for mack brown and the texas longhorns young helped texas finish the season undefeated and posted one of the best individual performances in the bcs national championship game well we couldnt stop them when we had to usc coach pete carroll said following his teams loss in the national championship the quarterback vince young ran all over the place when young decided to forego his senior season and enter the nfl draft brown looked to redshirt freshman colt mccoy to fill youngs massive shoes unlike young mccoy was not a highlytouted recruit but he embraced the role of the underdog in his breakout redshirt freshman season the once 3star prospect according to rivals com continued his quest to prove the critics wrong by leading texas to a record during his four seasons as the longhorns starting quarterback including a win over ohio state in the fiesta bowl a big title and berth in the bcs national championship game unfortunately the season did not have the storybook ending of mccoy went down with a numb right arm in the longhorns first offensive drive of the national championship which forced brown to rely on true freshman quarterback garrett gilbert to take the reins against alabamas elite defense the true freshman did all that he could in a game of that magnitude but it was not enough as the crimson tide rolled the longhorns gilbert entering the national championship game and ending texas perfect season was the first sign of the rocky road that lied ahead for brown the fall from gracefollowing the longhorns loss to alabama dennis dodd asked brown if texas would have won had mccoy not left the game with an injury to which brown responded wouldnt have been close the what ifs flooded mack browns brain after the season so much that he lost focus of the future harry how getty images texas abandoned the run game for a spreadattack with mccoy at quarterback but when mccoy left the bcs title game against alabama texas had zero run game to fall back on which forced brown to change the direction of the offense in with colt we just went to spread passing offense and then we just quit running it brown said in a spring football press conference i was furious at the colorado game that we walked out of there against a defense which had not played great and we could not make a 3rdand2 that is what we have to get back to it sounds good in theory but brown lacked two key factors in this offensive change legitimate running backs and a talented offensive line those issues were just the beginning of the lacking longhorns texas was coming off of an eightyear span where upperclassmen leaders and quarterbacks led the summer workout programs in the summer of vince young wrote on a bulletin board if you want to beat ohio state meet me here every night at p m the whole team showed up everyday the summer program in lacked the accountability and leadership of years past to say the least in july the longhorns lost a noncontact sevenonseven meeting to then fcs texas state the bobcats finished their season texas entered the season ranked no in the nation with high expectations among the coaches players and fans but what followed was one of the most epic collapses in the history of college football triggering a difficult selfreflection of brown and a complete overhaul of his staff the best example of the turmoil followed the longhorns october loss to iowa state in post game brown said im fighting my guts out to get it turned youve just got to stay after them every day you cant trust your team you cant trust your coaches when theyre not getting things ready to go macks public postgame questioning of his team and coaches divided the texas football program to the point of no return following the longhorns season brown went into seclusion and sought guidance from family friends and outside consultants on how to fix the issues at texas moving forward rebuilding i felt like i had a hangover after the national championship game brown said of the bcs national championship game i dont know if ive ever taken a loss so hard browns selfdescribed hangover caused a ripple affect of six coaching changes following the meltdown of but brown was given the benefit of the doubt from his bossestexas athletic director deloss dodds and university of texas president bill powersto rebuild the shattered foundation of the texas football program through all of the changes brown managed to hold together the rivals com thirdranked recruitingclass in and sold the texas fans on the idea of a brickbybrick rebuild of texas football some texas fans bought in while others did not but in the end brown finished his first rebuilding season with an record and a speech at texas footballs annual banquet that set the tone of the longhorns future a win over cal in the holiday bowl will be a springboard to another national championship in the next two to three years browns season finished one win better than with an upset over oregon state in the alamo bowl browns remarks at the longhorns football banquet pointed to the seasons as texas next national title runs but after starting the season with a losing record heading into big conference play the questions surrounding texas football do not have to do with the longhorns bcs national championship chances but rather the chances of texas slipping into the mentality in what could very likely be browns last hurrah as the longhorns head coach can mack brown avoid another downfall stacy revere getty images just when the media and bob stoops were about to put the final nail in his coffin good ol mack brown went out and beat the oklahoma sooners it remains unclear if the win was browns red river encore and the

3 after the dallas cowboys crucial win against division rivals the washington redskins there is a lot up for discussion for the team who will now have to go head to head with the philadelphia eagles to take first place in the nfc east in other words dont get your hopes up dallas faithful yes the cowboys win on sunday has them atop the nfc east alongside the eagles but the injuryplagued boys still

be able to give their loyal fan base any type of gratification im not convinced as much as i want to believe in the dallas cowboys the romo era has produced one playoff berth one playoff victory and a multitude of average seasons the cowboys lack of production and success is not all romos fault or jessica simpsons back in the day he needs better protection and the defense desperately needs to improve mikehunt whats the difference between the dallas cowboys and a good football team good teams go to the playoffs and win the cowboys have been playing better football losing in a heartbreaker to unstoppable peyton manning and the denver broncos but still have a good chance of being a team at the end of the season they still have to play the new orleans saints chicago bears and green bay packers after they play the eagles without two starters the fan base is loyal and has stuck by the cowboys through worse but as of right now i wouldnt get my hopes up cowboy nation
3 it seems that interceptionitis is a disease passed on from one jets quarterback to another the new york jets need to find a cure but the first step is diagnosing the nature of the affliction which has lingered since since then jets quarterbacks have thrown combined interceptions tied for secondmost in the nfl the primary source of those interceptions was quarterback mark sanchez but the issues have persisted with rookie geno smith at the helm in what causes the illness seems to always change even if it always has the same symptoms whether its a bad read a bad route by the receiver bad blocking by the line a poor play call or simply solid play from the defense theres something to be learned from every interception so lets take a look back at all of them first interception week vs buccaneerscause splitbad pass protection from the offensive line bad throw from the quarterbackthe jets had the ball in enemy territory and were moving thanks to a big play by wide receiver jeremy kerley and a big penalty by buccaneers safety dashon goldson its tough to tell exactly who smith was trying to get the ball to on this particular play smiths first career pick was a confluence of circumstances but ultimately he didnt have enough time in the pocket and didnt have enough of a window to fit the pass through hes being pressured fairly quickly off the snap given just seconds to get the pass off and had to deliver it off his back foot to his checkdown running back chris ivory however while he had one defensive lineman breathing down his neck another was waiting patiently for smith to throw the ball to stick his hand up smith tried to fit the ball over the head of the defensive lineman but the ball sailed a bit too high and allowed linebacker lavonte david to make the interception with more time a better pocket to set his feet and or no defensive linemen lifting their arms up this ball may have been on target second interception week vs new england patriotscause bad decision from the quarterbacksmiths second pick of the season didnt come until the fourth quarter of the next game against the patriots the jets came out in the personnel grouping with one running back one tight end andthree wide receivers with geno smith in the shotgun the pass was supposed to be a rhythm throw likely to receiver santonio holmes on the slant that ended up being smiths target anyway but it took him awhile to make the throw with a clean pocket he scrambled to his left roughly seconds after the snap he had the right idea as he saw green spaces out to his left he could probably have gained a few yards on the scramble if he had just tucked it and ran hemight have even been able to run for the first down instead he tried to force it in to holmes who was crossing the field with cornerback kyle arrington covering him in the slot smith threw the ball slightly behind holmes but the receiver didnt do him any favors by drifting away from the throw not toward it you could say this is a bad throw since he didnt put it out in front of his receiver but it started with the decision to throw in the first place without it there would be no interception to speak of third interception week vs new england patriotscause bad throw from the quarterbackgeno smith had the right idea on his next interception but he didnt get enough on the ball the jets came out in the personnel package two running backs three wide receivers with two routes being run to the left and backs flanking smith on either side their responsibility was to pick up a blitz if need be or leak into the flat after getting a chip on the rushers either way they were in max protection to help buy smith as much time as he needed to make his read and to let the routes develop it only took smith seconds to make a decision and he made the right one given the coverage the patriots were in cover robber as they were for most of the game with safety steve gregory underneath and devin mccourty deep mccourtys job was to roll into deep coverage from the right side of the field but he couldnt get across the whole field in time to help on the deep route by wide receiver clyde gates on the opposite side gates quickly got inside position on cornerback alfonzo dennardand had his man beat by a step and was pulling away if smith had put this ball over the top it would have at least been a big play if not a score instead he delivered it a bit short and allowed dennard to get back inside to make the pick smith had a perfectly clean pocket to step into but still couldnt get enough on the ball perhaps the driving rain had an impact but regardless smith had a big opportunity here and let it get away with a bad throw fourth interception week vs new england patriotscause bad throw from the quarterbackthe rain was still coming down pretty hard even late in the fourth quarter of this game but the jets kept throwing the ball and geno smith kept making them pay with bad throws the jets once again came out in the shotgun with the personnel grouping secondyear wideout stephen hill circled in yellow ran a deep pattern on the right with gates running the same pattern on the opposite side of the field and holmes running a route over the middle from the slot the patriots responded with the nickel defense and were in a cover shell to keep everything in front of the safeties as it turns out they didnt need to smith had a pretty big window to complete the pass but smith put the pass way too far behind hill and cornerback aqib talib was climbing in their windows and snatching their passes up there was no disruption in the pocket and smith got the pass off in seconds good decision just a bad throw fifth interception week vs buffalo billscause bad decision from the quarterbacksmith has been asked to throw deep as frequently as almost any other quarterback15 percent of his aimed pass attempts have traveled yards or more through the air sometimes though he just needs to take what the defense gives him the jets came out in the personnel groupingone running back two tight ends two wide receiverswith smith in the shotgun the bills responded with their base defense the route combination on the left side is intended to attack the deep safety on that side whichever way the safety goes the throw goes the opposite geno had plenty of time in the pocket with seconds before he released the pass the problem however came in his progressions tight end kellen winslow came open over the middle of the field right as smith pulled the trigger on the throw into double coverage kellen winslow is a mismatch for linebackers and with safety jim leonhard so deep in coverage there was no way anyone would make a play on the ball if he was going to throw to holmes he should have either thrown it much earlier or much deeper than he did he waited until holmes ran into the coverage of leonhard but there was a small window to complete the pass if he had released it half a second earlier having waited he should have thrown it longer so that at the worst it would sail over everyone and fall incomplete sixth interception week vs buffalo billscause bad read by the quarterback great play by the defense coverage one common problem a rookie quarterback runs into is staring down his first read which allows defenders to cheat by breaking toward the play early thats what happened on the sixth interception of geno smiths career the jets came out in the shotgun with the personnel grouping and the bills matched with a nickel defense the throw was intended to be a quick hit to gates circled in yellow running a fiveyard slant route on the left side smith took the snap and dropped back looking at gates the whole time this allowed linebacker kiko alonso circled in red to get a jump on the ball smith made alonsos job easy by staying on his first and only read alonso may also be a rookie but he has sharp instincts in coverage and made the right decision by breaking on the pass as gates broke across the field behind him smith got the pass off in just seconds and there was no pressure in his face he had enough time and protection to go through his progressions this is a rookie mistake seventh interception week vs tennessee titanscause bad throw and decision by the quarterbacksmith nearly got his receiver killed on his first interception against the tennessee titans in what would amount to a fourturnover game the jets set up play action with the personnel two running backs one tight end two wide receivers with the two backs lined up behind smith in the iformation both backs were in protection after the play fake as was the tight end as the jets tried to set up a big play to either stephen hill circled in yellow orsantonio holmes they only had the two receivers running routes though and smith had no outlet if neither of them were openwhich ended up being the case the titans sent five defenders on the initial rush with a sixth joining the fray once the backs stayed in the backfield even with so many players in protection smith still ended up feeling the pressure from the backside that being said smith still had seconds to get this pass away he threw for the post but thats a hard throw to make with the safety in cover because hes right there to make a hit over the middle thats exactly what happened and hill was hit hard as titans cornerback alterraun verner jumped in front of the pass and made the interception a deeper throw might have been complete but at worst it would have fallen to the turf smith didnt have much to work with on this play given the design leaving him only two options with neither of them open upon initial read he should probably have just taken the sack the quarterbacks job is to make the best play possible even if that means eating the ball behind the line of scrimmage eighth interception week vs tennessee titanscause bad decision by the quarterback great defensive play coverage geno had no business making this throw the jets lined up in the personnel grouping with running back bilal powell flanking smith to the left and three receivers out right holmes circled in yellow ran a curl route on the offenses left and was wellcovered by verner come to think of it wellcovered might be an understatement blanketed works better there was no way this pass would be complete smith got the ball off in seconds after the snap and once again didnt come off his first readdespite that read being completely covered there was no pressure so smith could have spent a bit more time in the pocket making his decision instead he hastily pulled the trigger and hoped his receiver could bail him out as the primary read its holmes responsibility to win this matchup however as the quarterback its smiths job to make another read if the first one isnt open ninth interception week vs pittsburgh steelerscause bad decision by the quarterbackso many bad things happened on this play its impossible to assign blame to one player the jets came out in the personnel package with one running back two tight ends and two wide receivers the steelers matched with their base defense and came out in a cover shell jeremy kerley was covered by a linebacker on the play and ran straight downfield into double coverage hindsight is but perhaps smith could have audibledkerley into a different route to exploit the mismatch tight end konrad reuland circled in yellow motioned from the left side of the formation to the right he ran down field while covered by cornerback william gay who held him up a bit outside of the fiveyard window and through him off his route smith was likely expecting reulandto be able to get past gay and threw the ball toward the pylon where the tight end might have been had he been given a free release instead safety ryan clark was waiting right in the area of the pass and intercepted it there were three defenders in the vicinity of the pass as smith was throwing it and there was very little chance of cumberland getting there before one of those three steelers defenders geno had seconds in the pocket to make his decision no one was open so its quite possible that any decision here would have been the wrong one 10th interception week vs pittsburgh steelerscause bad protection by the offensive line great defensive play pressure the jets were still down by two possessions when smith threw his second and final pick of the day against the steelers the jets came out with the personnel with three players running routes on the right three receivers ran a route that finished in the end zone the steelers played man coverage with a cover shell on the back end a lot went wrong on this play no one got open the offensive line let a defender break through and geno threw the pass while being decked he had just shy of three seconds to make a decision and with better protection he might have been able to deliver the pass to cumberland who was coming open in the back of the end zone at the time final tallyfive bad decisions four bad throws one bad read two bad protections five great defensive plays three pressure two coverage that adds up to more than but thats because sometimes more than one person deserves credit and more than one person deserves blame its important that we remember while these interceptions all look equal on the stat sheet they are not equal in how to correct them smith is guilty of some bad decisions but sometimes he just needs to trust his arm weve seen him chuck the ball downfield with regularity this year and hes been one of the nfls most accurate quarterbacks in that sense accuracy percentage on throws of yards or more but he still dramatically underthrows receivers at times he has the arm talent but sometimes things just dont all click exactly as they shouldthats to be expected for a rookie even some of his bad throws were just a result of poor timing or bad decisions with time and experience thoseshould go away whether theydo will decide whether smith reaches his full potential as an nfl quarterback follow erikfrenzerikfrenzis also apatriots afc east writer for boston com unless otherwise noted allquotes obtained

4 for some teams nba training camp is about cleaning off the rust after a summer away from the game and preparing for the physical grind of an 82game regular season for others like the detroit pistons its a time to align a number of moving pieces and get them all functioning as a cohesive machine with a common goal detroits offseason featured a dramatic overhaul both on its roster and along the sideline at full strength thats a tremendous challenge to undertake even the twotime defending champion miami heat needed a full season together before solving their championship puzzle but these pistons arent at full strength and their most recent subtraction will be their most painful via vincent ellis of thedetroit free press pistons announce brandon jennings out at least three weeks with impacted wisdom tooth and hairline fracture of mandible at base of tooth vincent ellis vincent ellis56 october 2013brandon jennings the man with the greatest say in snapping detroits current fouryear playoff drought might not miss a lot of regularseason action but his absence casts an ominous shadow over what should have been a season of hope for the pistons next man upany time a player goes down with an injury teams rally around his exit and cite the importance of a collective rise in his absence if it was only so easy the pistons arent without other options at the lead guard spot but try to find the name that instills the most confidence from whats left bynum billups siva kcp singler pistons still have enough backcourt depth but datome stuckey jennings absences limits flexibility keith langlois keith langlois october 2013not so easy is it theres quantity here but wheres the quality you have a hasbeen 37yearold chauncey billups a neverwas will bynum career points per game and a host of unproven performers kyle singler and rookies kentavious caldwellpope and peyton siva billups has to be on a minutes restriction at this stage of his career hes played just games over the last two seasons combined when he wasnt donning david sternapproved street clothes on the los angeles clippers sideline he was servingas a floor spacer threepoint percentage not a setup man assists per game as per rotoworld andrew d bernstein getty images bynum is the type of player fans hope gets put on a minutes restriction he cant shoot career threepoint percentage and makes questionable decisions with the basketball career assists against turnovers now years old hes not likely to raise his ceiling above mediocre career player efficiency rating singler and caldwellpope are wing players so their presences dont help here siva was the 56th player selected in junes draft which says everything you need to know about his pro potential rodney stuckey might be an option if not for the fact that hes sidelined himself with a fracture in his thumb not to mention hes more of a scorer career points per game than a distributor assists jennings was the only one of this bunch expected to consistently move the needle for the pistons that might not speak highly of joe dumars summer renovationconsidering jennings is just a percent shooter from the field for his careerbut speaks even lower about the players behind him on the depth chart jennings has his own red flags but at least hes a proven scorer career points per game and a serviceable decision maker assists against turnovers in career minutes per game allen einstein getty images his reputation as a scorer will demand more defensive attention than any of his backcourt teammates will get that extra perimeter attention offered the most hope that maurice cheeks could actually survive with an oversized frontcourt in todays downsizing league jennings biggest challenge was supposed to be making all of these new players mesh and leading the playoffhopeful pistons strong out of the gate now hell be forced to play a game of catch up that just might undermine this teams chance for success lost time never returnstheres no telling how long jennings will be out but whatever time is missed will be just thatmissed time he cant return to health and suddenly be transported back to the early stages of training camp this isnt baseball there is no extended spring training for him to work his way back into the teams plans when hes ready to go hell be unleashed the onus falls on him and his teammates to catch their collective rhythm on the fly the pistons have more new players this season eight than old ones seven the coaching staff was gutted over the summer this was supposed to be the time when these new pieces came together and forged their unity when cheeks figured out how to make three talented postoriented players josh smith greg monroe and andre drummond work alongside a shootfirst point guard allen einstein getty images and when that shootfirst point guard jennings proved he really could be a distributor that his former milwaukee bucks really had plagued his production the way he told nbc sports dan feldman they did this was the time for jennings to find his comfort zone one that hopefully looked nothing like his old one a chance for him to hone his passing skills and figure out how to complement his

3 just as everyone expected the san diego chargers beat the indianapolis colts on monday night football in week just as everyoneexpected the colts offense didnt score a touchdown and just as everyone expected andrew luck not philip rivers threw a gameending interception in the fourth quarter stay unpredictable nfl coming into the primetime showdown only the denver broncos were averaging more yards points and touchdowns per drive than indianapolis according to football outsiders conversely perfootball outsiders the chargers had allowed the most yards per drive in the nfl and were 22nd in touchdowns allowed per drive sure four colts drops were costlythree of which were more costly than the average dropbut in the end the highpowered smash mouth indianapolis attack wasnt able to reach the end zone against one of the leagues most vulnerable defenses in a defeat kevork djansezian getty images but enough about colts how about the chargers a team many thought would be fighting for one of the top selections in the draft this season their win over indianapolis put them at smackdab in the middle of the pack in the afc the chargers are one of five teams with a record in the conference

wide open however its not as wide open as the massive collection of mediocre teams within two games of each other would suggest and the proof is in san diegos division kyle rivas getty images the broncos and kansas city chiefs are both meaning at this point the team that doesnt win the afc west would appear to be bound for the top wildcard spot in the conference therefore barring a somewhat large collapse by either the chiefs or the broncosteams with threegame division leads on the chargers at this pointan assortment of afc clubs will be vying for only one wildcard spot down the stretch although san diego is currently the last place team in the afc theyll have ample opportunity to change that over the next two months heres a look at their upcoming schedule san diego chargers upcoming

oakland raiders17vs kansas city chiefsespnwhile the chargers most recent victory on the national stage reaffirmed the idea that the nfl is essentially impossible to predict lets run through each game left on san diegos schedule at jacksonville jaguars the jaguars played the mighty broncos tough in denver but this is a game the chargers should win on the road its probably the easiest road game in football this season at washington redskins its hard to gauge the redskins as robert griffin iii is playing a bit better but not up to the level in which he showed as a rookie washingtons defense has struggled mightily in all areas vs denver broncos clearly the most difficult home game of the year in all likelihood the chargers offense will have to score more than points to win at miami dolphins ryan tannehill is one of the leagues better young quarterbacks and cameron wake is an elite passrusher miamis offensive line is its most glaring weak spot at kansas city chiefs the chiefs are getting it done with the nfls most stingy defense gamemanaging quarterback play from alex smith and efficient running from jamaal charles in kansas city this game will be a nice barometer for the chargers vs cincinnati bengals although the bengals are leading the afc north through six weeks this game could have major wildcard implications vs new york giants the giants have been an absolute mess this season at home the chargers have to take care of business at denver broncos easily the most difficult contest on the schedule the broncos could be playing for playoff positioninghomefield advantagein the playoffs at this point vs oakland raiders the raiders arent exactly the pushover they used to be mainly due to the development of ultraathletic quarterback terrelle pryor and an underrated defense vs kansas city chiefs the final game of the season rarely decides a teams playoff fate but with the jumbled afc a win and the chargers could be in a loss and they could be out based on what weve seen from every team in the first six weeks of the season the chargers remaining schedule wouldnt be considered a walk in the park but its not ridiculously difficult either while absolutely nothing is guaranteed in todays paritydriven nfl lets assume for the sake of the argument that the chargers will beat the currently winless jaguars and giants beyond that san diego will likely have to go in the other eight games to reach a final regularseason record of is it possible well a myriad of factors will play into the chargers chances to reach the postseason but at least their quarterback is playing

3 this time a year ago kansas state was and fresh off a win over iowa state five days later the wildcats would beat west virginia in morgantown on their way to an season had baylor not shocked kstate in midnovember the cats may have been playing for a bcs championship how things have changed since then last saturday baylor and kansas state met once again a victory for the bears this time the bears have the undefeated record and national title aspirations and the wildcats are just trying to make it to a bowl game the loss to baylor put kstate at and in big conference playnot what fans in manhattan have become accustomed to lately even in the forgettable three years under ron prince kstate never started the first six games of a season like this in fact you have to go back to when bill snyder was in his first run as kstates head coach to get those records for what its worth kansas state finished that season ronald martinez getty images ksus tough start caught the attention of yahoo sports pat forde who named snyder his not coach of the midyear in his weekly column not coach of the midyear bill snyder kansas state he was the toast of the league last year but at its been a stark comeuppance for the manhattan legend the wildcats are a unsnyderlike minus9 in turnovers this season and could wind up with their first losing record since the regrettable ron prince era forde has a point about kstate looking unlike itself lately the wildcats finished in the top nationally in turnover margin the previous two years per ncaa stats the lowest point this year came in a loss to oklahoma state in which the cats had penalties for yards and five turnovers but a closer look indicates that this team is actually getting better ifthats not the sign of vintage snyderball then nothing is take kstates seasonopening loss to north dakota state the bison drove yards on plays to score the gamewinning touchdown with seconds remaining in the game since then kansas states defense has done a better job of getting off the field the last opponent to consistently move the ball down the field on kstate was texas in a win in week the horns had three scoring possessions of at least plays spanning yards or more ronald martinez getty images that was three games ago and remember this is a defense replacing a majority of its starters from a year ago against baylor in week kstate held the best offense in the country to half of its season average in points and a percent thirddown completion percentage the bears live off of big plays and quick scoring strikes while baylor still manageda few of those snyders defense did a great job of keeping everything in front of them normally time of possession is a meaningless stat for baylor because the offense has had no problem scoring but if touchdowns arent easy to come by possessions and time become more important thats another area where kansas state excelled against the bears controlling the clock and running the ball the yards kstate had on the ground were by far the best this season against teams not named umass baylors defense may not be particularly stout but running the ball is kstates strength on offense with quarterback daniel sams making a majority of those plays the wildcats offense looks more like the ones of the past two or three years the yards on the ground ksu had against north dakota state in week looked nothing like it ndsu and baylor may have both resulted in losses for kansas state but theres no debate the wildcats looked like a completely different team in week than they did in week a much better team
3 the longhorn win in the red river shootout was likely the last time that mack brown and bob stoops square off in the contest at the texas state fair brown a coach who appears to be on his way out after seasons in austin and total as a head coach is providing a glimpse to the inevitable future of stoops brown got the best of stoops in what is likely their last battlestoops and brown are forever tied together arriving in the big just a year apart and working seemingly in unison to elevate two of college footballs most storied programs the two men pushed each other to excel stoops early success forced brown to elevate his game and ultimately both would win national titles this is stoops fifteenth season as a head coach nearly half that of mack brown and although he seems to be going strong the long play for big game bob is the same as all of the coaches before him in this era an era where coaches are hired to be fired where what have you done for me lately is all that matters and where even to buy time at a job heads have to roll somewhere mack brown fired longtime assistant greg davis in brought in new faces on offense in an effort to right his ship this year the head coach pushed manny diaz out as defensive coordinator in hopes of getting on track mark richt two seasons behind stoops as a head coach with years at georgia showed friend willie martinez the door and brought in todd grantham to show the higherups that he still wanted to win even americas longest tenured college head coach frank beamer at virginia tech has had to restructure his staff in an effort to chase down success and bob stoops has already had to do the same there was willie martinez the first firing of an assistant that stoops ever made then came james patton jackie shipp and bruce kittle after the season as new ok reported stoops has reshuffled the deck and let people know he intends to keep winning however with years in the tank at oklahoma stoops is going to need to find more success soon before the natives get restless 2008s bcs championship appearance memories are fading and the title win seems so long ago the sooners with the loss to texas in dallas again fit the bill of a team that is good but not good enough close but not quite there is a problem of varying degrees on the collegiate landscape for some schools being in the hunt is acceptable for others winning it all is the metric by which success is measured at oklahoma winning ten a year will get you far but fans will certainly need another knock on the door of a championship soon for now stoops is on solid ground he wins far more than he loses keeps the sooners in the big hunt and keeps his team in the top mack brown is not so much a cautionary tale as an example of how the business works for coaches of today bob stoops is not immune to that reality no coach is his best bet is to keep piling up wins and hopefully go out on his own terms if not stoops will be the guy who ultimately has to go despite what he has meant to the university

4 you wouldnt know it from his highlight reels but andrew wiggins isnt the perfect prospect hes got a few wrinkles that need to be ironed out before making his jump to the nba life wiggins is certainly good to go from a physical standpoint hell enter the league as one of the elitelevel athletes in the game from day but in terms of fundamentals and mechanics wiggins could use a little refining ballhandling wiggins doesnt have a poor handle it just doesnt give him an advantage he relies on a blur of a first step and blowby explosiveness to attack the rim as a perimeter scorer wiggins relies on elevating higher than his man and shooting over the top he lacks that command of the ballthat ability to put a defender on skates or tie ones laces together with dribble misdirection a better handle could help improve his shot selection particularly on the perimeter where it would allow for a smoother transition into a more balanced jump shot hes also vulnerable to tunnel vision or making up his mind without allowing it to change as a scorer you need that tight handle to be able to set up the pullup or stepback jumper you need it to split double teams or to separate against premierlockdown defendersthe type wiggins is going to see on a consistent basis in the pros the whole shotcreating process starts with the dribble and wiggins needs some finetuning below youll see wiggins has the ball on the wing with the space to pull up for an uncontested jumper but his choppy handle doesnt allow him to get there and smoothly set up into his delivery resulting in an unforced turnover instead of an easy scoring opportunity his handle is bound to improve as he continues to develop but it could be an initial hurdle once he makes the jump from freshman to rookie shot selectionwiggins can get a little lazy at time with his shot selection hes got tremendous scoring confidence which makes him believe any shot he gets off is a makeable one that leads to a few questionable attempts per game below youll see wiggins catch the ball on the wing where he has angles and a driving lane to attack wiggins eventually gets a screen forcing the defenders to switch leaving wiggins with a sizable mismatch wiggins puts it on the floor and without an attempt to beat his man north and south chooses to pick up his dribble and step back for a lowpercentage look its a heroball shot and one that wiggins should try and cut out from his arsenal for the time being outside shooting rangewiggins is a shotmaker not a shooter with the difference being a shotmaker is capable while a shooter is proficient he cant connect yet with enough consistency particularly from behind the arc wigginscan knock them down but his chances of doing so drop dramatically the further he is from the rim his strength as a scorer is finishing in the lane by becoming a bigger threat from outside hell have a counter for defenses who choose to pack the paint and take away the drive you just wont find too many nba scoring wings who cant take over a game with the long ball recognizing scoring opportunities identifying best optionthe top scorers are able to recognize what tool to use for each dilemma they face when the defense takes an option away from a scorer it usually gives him an additional one elsewhere and for wiggins to maximize his offensive potential he needs to be able to recognize what that option is and how to attack it check out wiggins in a scoring sweet spot on the wing with a rim protector in position down low its going to be tough for wiggins to get to the rack for a balanced scoring opportunity given the traffic and awaiting defenders in the paint wiggins has to be able to recognize this and identify what the higher percentage scoring opportunity would be take a look at all the space he has in the midrange between his man and the interior defense thats plenty of room for wiggins to pull up or step back for a jumper which in this case would be a much higher percentage look than an offbalance contested runner instead he chooses to recklessly drive into traffic with nowhere to go and coughs the ball up its not as if hes incapable of hitting or creating that midrange jumperits just a matter of recognizing it was the better play for that particular scoring opportunity wiggins decisionmaking process will be easier once his handle and outside accuracy improve when they do hell be more comfortable operating and executing from different spots on the floor stay engagedany scouting report youll read on wiggins will tell you the exact same thinghe tends to drift the game just comes so easy to him that he doesnt always appear to be locked in mentally andrew wiggins has tremendous ability upside but long way to go needs to play hard all the time was 5th or 6thbest player in practice jeff goodman goodmanespn october 2013its unlikely to impact his draft stock as his talent is too overwhelming but if wiggins wants to compete with the big boys every night hell need to bring it on every possessionespecially if he wants to live up to the ridiculous hype that surrounds him at the end of the day even the current top nba players all had weaknesses at years old the fact that wiggins has a few doesnt lower his towering ceiling they just represent the immediate challenges hell face as he makes his highly anticipated transition
3 the new york jets coming off a triumphant comeback win onmonday night football blew a chance to solidify themselves as a legitimate playoff contender in week falling at home to the previously winless steelers rookie quarterback geno smith put forth his best performance as a pro on the national stage in week but regressed into the turnoverladen player who struggled mightily through the first four games of the season smith chucked two illadvised passes into thick coverage deep inside steelers territory in the second half of the jets defeat promptly eliminating any chance the team had at achieving another comeback win the secondround pick is enduring predictable sequences of upsanddowns as the jets signalcaller he features incredible arm strength to complement gamewinning intangibles smith has led the jets to three fourth quarter wins in in essence the jets have won three games because of smiths gameplay instead of in spite of it which was often the case when former starting qb mark sanchez was running the offense geno smiths statistics cmp attyardstdintin wins56 8778663in losses57 10370417total113 1901 490710espn comsmiths numbers through six games are pedestrian however he boasts enormous upside and could potentially be the jets longterm solution at quarterback smith has racked up passing yards and seven touchdowns in six starts good enough for a quarterback rating hes completed just percent of his pass attempts though a startling figure for a guy who connected on percent of his throws as a senior at west virginia the most intriguing element of the jets drafting smith was his seeming aptitude to protect the football he threw just interceptions in three full seasons as a starter at the collegiate level but has already hurled picks as a pro hes also coughed up the football four times on the ground the learning curve continues to be a difficult process for smith to conquer hes displayed flashes of brilliancelike his last second gamewinning drive at the georgia dome in week 5but has also looked terribly incapable of sustaining consistent productivity from the pocket the interception that smith chucked into triple coverage near the right end zone pylon in the third quarter of the jets most recent defeat was inexplicably bad rich schultz getty images that decision couldnt simply be defined as an illadvised throw it was a headscratching mistake which essentially sealed the deal for the steelers the jets needed to come away with points on that drive down in the face of a steelers passing attack that was clicking on all cylinders if the jets are going to beat their archrival the new england patriots in week smith needs to demonstrate better ability to protect the football its a seemingly simple concept although it seldom occurs smith has been turnoverfree in just one game so far this season his aggressive style of play effectively mirrors offensive coordinator marty mornhinwegs attackoriented style of playcalling however smith needs to quickly learn that pushing the envelope against thick coverage is a loselose situation in addition smith needs to better adapt to pressurecooker situations when the pocket collapses hes been blatantly vulnerable to being hurried in pass situations a weakness that steelers defensive coordinator dick lebeau exposed with a makeshift pass rush on sunday the steelers entered week with just four total sacks on defense but registered three on the stat sheet against the jets new york is hardpressed for playmakers on offense increasing the necessity for smith to perform at a high level it remains unknown if supposed no wide receiver santonio holmes will play on sunday against the patriots secondyear wideout stephen hill who has shown signs of significant improvement suffered a concussion in the jets week loss at tennessee hill was the victim of a vicious hit by explosive safety troy polamalunear the end of the first half the speedy receiver has caught just passes on targets this season a substantial issue for a team that needs its fastest player on offense to be a constant downfield threat smith had an opportunity to connect on a long touchdown pass to hill with the jets trailing in the second quarter but overthrew his man by a yard smith was promptly sacked on the subsequent play a midrange thirddown attempt which allowed lebeau to dial up the pressure mitchell leff getty images the jets will look to rebound against the patriots who feature a mediocre defense that yields a ton of yards on the ground new england ranks 24th in the league against the rush giving up yards per game new york will be forced to regroup after losing tailback mike goodson who suffered anacl and mcl tearagainst the steelers for the season goodson played in just two games for the jets in racking up rushing yards on seven carries and two receptions for yards the game plan against the patriots should showcase a healthy dose of dependable running back bilal powell who continues to impress by averaging yards per carry on attempts this season rb chris ivory should also endure an increased workload in week hes carried the ball just four times in each of the jets past three games but is a valuable component of the teams offense and will likely be more heavily utilized in the wake of goodsons seasonending injury a productive run game would serve the purpose of easing some pressure off of smith who has completed more than percent of his pass attempts in just two games this season the patriots are relatively effective against the pass giving up yards through the air per game smith is averaging passing yards per contest a number that has remained mostly static on a weektoweek basis smith will likely need to rely more on tight end jeff cumberland against new england due to a multitude of injuries on offense cumberland has caught receptions for yards and two touchdowns in five starts hes only been targeted times but boasts the highest pass completion percentage of any jets receiver at rich schultz getty images at and pounds cumberland is a versatile player who excels in run blocking situations and also features above average routerunning skills the jets need cumberland to produce on offense in week although the patriots were stout in defending pro bowl tight end jimmy graham last week graham led the nfl in receiving yards through the first five weeks of the season stopping graham was an obvious point of emphasis for the patriots in practice leading up to their week clash with new orleans graham was held without a catch on six targets promptly slowing down the saints potent air brigade in the patriots only loss their defense gave up a combined total of nine receptions for receiving yards on targets to bengals tight ends tyler eifert and jermaine gresham its ultimately pertinent for the jets to efficiently run the football and find a way to get cumberland involved on offense especially considering the teams bangedup core of wide receivers if new york fails to take advantage of the patriots suspect rush defense theyll be staring down a record which would put them three games behind new england in the afc east

2 its perhaps the most important match in armenias obscure footballing history as they look to clinch a playoff spot in a mustwin scenario against cesare prandellis italian national team with that being said the azzurri can see this game as a glorified friendly and will continue to experiment with the formation and lineup as they did against denmark could not get tweet oembed code for tweet 389697416251064320as listed above prandelli will try out lazios federico marchetti a goalkeeper who would be starting for almost any other nation his quick reflexes and athleticism are a welcome addition especially when faced with a oneonone scenario against a streaking opposing attacker prandelli should be fielding a formation with the speedy ignazio abate as the right fullback the seldom used manuel pasqual will operate on the opposite flank the leftfooted fiorentina wingback is an excellent crosser of the ball and will look to sling them in as he pushes forward the center back pair is a purely experimental one with davide astori set to make only his seventh appearance with the senior side claudio villa getty images alessandro florenzi has been the revelation of the season under rudi garcia theres plenty of technique in the midfield with andrea pirlo pulling the strings in front of the defense hell be joined by two other creative midfieldersalberto aquilani and riccardo montolivo expect montolivo to take a no role in the formation linking midfield with attack its a highly deserved start for midfielder alessandro florenzi a player who has thrived as a right winger in rudi garcias revamped roma side florenzi is highly versatile and can play in the middle of the park and the wing where he loves to track back and help out the defense as well as venture forward up front is where it gets entertaining milans bad boy mario balotelli will give the azzurri an element of unexpected brilliance as he joins the electrifying lorenzo insigne claudio villa getty images lorenzo insigne is the ideal partner for balotelli will lorenzo insigne and mario balotelli be italys striking pair in yesno someone else should partner with balotelli submit votevote to see resultswill lorenzo insigne and mario balotelli be italys striking pair in yes52 no someone else should partner with balotelli 47 total votes if br polldata br polldata if br polldata br polldata id question will lorenzo insigne and mario balotelli be italys striking pair in choices choice0 count choice yes choice6 count choice choice1 count choice no someone else should partner with balotelli choice7 count choice choice2 count choice choice8 count choice choice3 count choice choice9 count choice choice4 count choice choice5 count choice sidebar false if br poll br poll showresults false
3 brown continues to churn out sizeable chunks of yardage in limited action hes totaled yards on carries but its taken him four games to reach those totals and faces the leagues top rush defense in the denver broncos in week the broncos rush defense is a little deceiving as teams are simply passing all game against them in efforts to remain close brown will continue to struggle for meaningful carries in week and would simply be a gamble selection for those in need due to a bye week
3 good news richardson is coming off his highest yards per carry of the season bad news richardson averaged four yards per carry on carries monday night at san diego hell face the leagues top ranked run defense in week the denver broncos richardson scored in his first two games with his new team but hasnt done so in consecutive weeks hes also caught just two passes since joining the colts in a game where indianapolis will likely need to pass often richardson may struggle for touches start trich at your own risk in week
3 hilton continues to search for consistency as the colts face the broncos in week hes coming off a fourth performance in six contests where hes managed yards or less hilton has two touchdowns on the year both of which came in week against seattle facing a struggling broncos secondary its reasonable to think hilton can post his third yard performance of the season but since hes been such a feast or famine option to date use hilton as a wr3 at your own risk
3 fleener is quietly the colts third leading receiver through six contests hes totaled yards and two touchdowns on catches and faces a struggling broncos pass defense in week fleener has labored to just yards and five grabs over the past two weeks its very difficult to trust him at this point but the upside remains in tact as a bye week plug in fleener has modest appeal against denver
3 mr reliable himself wayne again leads the colts in receiving yards receptions and targets hell look to reach the end zone for the third time sunday against a weak denver pass defense the upside may be gone from wayne as days of 140plus yards and multiple scores cant be counted on that said wayne is as steady as they come and should see a healthy dose of looks as the colts pitch it around the yard while trying to keep up with denvers high powered offense
3 luck is coming off of arguable his worst fantasy game of monday night at san diego he failed to produce a touchdown something that wont cut it for his owners or the colts as they hope to keep up with peyton mannings broncos in week lucks shoulder figures to get a workout on the short week the broncos rank last in the league in pass defense largely due to the amount of times opponents are forced to pass in order to remain in striking distance with the denver offense luck should be firmly back on qb1 radars in a game that could see some fireworks

3 schaub suffered a leg injury in week against st louis his status for week at kansas city is unknown as of tuesday schaub said his injury affects his knee ankle and foot and it could have been drastically worse schaub didnt throw an interception before leaving last sunday for the first time in eight games he still gives the texans there best chance to win but needs to be more of a game manager and wont help your team much even if he plays
3 johnson continues to produce steadily and again leads the texans in receptions yards and targets hes surprisingly hasnt scored in however a trend unlikely to be broken in week at kansas city johnson has a season long reception of just yards hes lost a little in his step and with uncertainty under center johnson is looking more like a possession receiver than big play threat the chiefs defense is fierce against the pass as well making johnson a wr2 play for week
3 tate saw carries for the first time all season in week against the rams he managed just yards however and has taken a back seat to a red hot arian foster while all signs point to tate again seeing minimal looks in week at kansas city he may not be as bad of an option as originally thought foster will again carry the load and no time share is imminent but if t j yates is under center for the texans theyd be wise to run as often as they can against a weaker kansas city rush defense carries for tate could have him flirting with flex appeal
3 graham made his first start of the season in week against st louis filling in for the injured owen daniels he produced just two catches for yards unfortunately houston travels to kansas city in week graham saw four targets which is less than the five and six targets he saw over the previous two weeks with daniels in the lineup its also unclear at this time whether t j yates or matt schaub will start at quarterback graham has a lot of factors working against him and will be a low end option in week as a result
3 foster has been the one bright spot in houston over the past three weeks while the offense is sputtering foster has at least touches in three straight games while posting an average of total yards in that span foster travels to kansas city in week houston doesnt know who their quarterback will be sunday and the chiefs defense ranks 23rd against the run allowing yards per game it all shapes into a nice match up for the surging foster who hasnt scored in two weeks
3 hopkins ranks second on the team in receiving yards with and third in targets with hell look for his first touchdown since week against tennessee this sunday at kansas city hopkins has only yards in the previous four games after his yard outburst against the titans with t j yates possibly starting under center on the road against a tough defense hopkins cant be trusted for much in week
3 bullock has hit just 9of14 field goals in his first six games totaling points hell search for consistency in a tough week match up at kansas city the chiefs are allowing just points per game this season and point at home opportunities for bullock and this struggling texans offense will be very difficult to come by sunday
3 yates would be in line to start sundays game at kansas city if matt schaubs leg injury proves to be too much yates tossed two interceptions in week after taking over for schaub the chiefs defense ranks third in the league in passing yards allowed surrendering just yards yates would be one of the lowest ranked quarterbacks of week should he draw the start kansas citys defense in turn would be a top option
3 there is no question that earlyround picks need to be productive in order to have fantasy football success but players who are picked up off the waiver wire or buried on your bench are often the ones who determine whether you win or lose in any given week that promises to be the case once again in week starting a player who isnt normally viewed as a fantasy starter can be risky business as the chances of a low score are quite high but sometimes the matchups dictate that its a good idea to take a chance with a couple of teams on the bye this week and a number of big injuries occurring as of late week is as good of a time as any to roll the dice here are three undertheradar players who may not be highly touted but are most definitely in line for big performances this week chad henneit is no secret that the jacksonville jaguars are arguably the nfls worst team but that doesnt mean that they are devoid of fantasy talent wide receivers cecil shorts and justin blackmon have proven to be valuable commodities and running back maurice jonesdrew can be productive against the right competition as well the quarterback position has been a huge issue for jacksonville in recent years however the team has been better off with chad henne rather than blaine gabbert henne will start against the san diego chargers in week according to the jags official twitter account chad henne was named the jaguars starting qb for sdvsjax more http t co zgtppicx0j jacksonville jaguars jaguars october 2013henne didnt throw for any touchdowns last week against the denver broncos but he did break the 300yard mark and make some plays down the field there should be some opportunities to rack up some yardage against the bolts too as they are surrendering almost passing yards per game they were able to hold andrew luck and the indianapolis colts in check on monday night but a lot of that was due to lucks receivers dropping easy passes henne isnt a longterm fantasy starter by any means but hes definitely an option for drew brees or terrelle pryor owners while they are on the bye san diego is a much better team than jacksonville which means henne will be throwing plenty as the jags attempt to come from behind that should allow him to go over yards once again in week week projection passing yards three touchdowns two interceptions benjarvus greenellis jonathan daniel getty images although he isnt the most explosive back in football cincinnati bengals running back benjarvus greenellis has been a productive player in the league for the past few years the law firm broke the 000yard mark last season and he is very strong in shortyardage situations including around the goal line greenellis is coming off his best yardage game of the season as he racked up against the buffalo bills and he has three touchdowns on the year as well on top of all that he has a great matchup on the horizon cincinnati will face the detroit lions in week so he is in prime position to have his best performance of the lions are allowing nearly yards per game and the bengals will unquestionably want to establish the run in order to keep matthew stafford reggie bush calvin johnson and the explosive lions offense off the field as much as possible that bodes well for greenellis but the one concern is gio bernards heavy workload as pointed out by john paulsen of fantasy pros greenellis with carries yards on snaps bernard with touches yards td on snaps john paulsen 4for4 john october 2013there is no doubt that bernards bigplay ability will keep him on the field but greenellis brings something different to the table which ensures he will still see his fair share of carries bernard was stuffed on a shortyardage play that could have iced the game for cincinnati against buffalo in week so look for the law firm to be in those situations moving forward greenellis is a great flex play or even an rb2 in week week projection rushing yards and two touchdowns riley cooper al bello getty images which undertheradar player will have the best fantasy performance in week chad hennebenjarvus greenellisriley coopersubmit votevote to see resultswhich undertheradar player will have the best fantasy performance in week chad henne36 benjarvus greenellis20 riley cooper44 total votes if br polldata br polldata if br polldata br polldata id question which undertheradar player will have the best fantasy performance in week choices choice0 count choice chad henne choice6 count choice choice1 count choice benjarvus greenellis choice7 count choice choice2 count choice riley cooper choice8 count choice choice3 count choice choice9 count choice choice4 count choice choice5 count choice sidebar false if br poll br poll showresults false

2 england desperately need a win against poland on tuesday although it will not be easy the squad currently stands one point ahead of ukraine in the group h table for uefa world cup qualifying however the secondplace team faces san marino in its final match a squad it defeated the last time they faced each other as a result an england loss or even a draw would likely not be enough to win the pool while the team would still have a chance to qualify through a playoff even that will not be easy with france portugal and others likely also heading towards the same fate the three lions must get a win against poland to avoid all of this controversy but it will need to follow these keys to make it happen control possession ian walton getty images england will be shorthanded defensively in this matchup with ashley cole injured and kyle walker suspended after being booked in the last match while leighton baines is a capable reserve the team does not want to take any chances in order to counter this they must make sure to limit polands chances on that end of the pitch the midfield has to control the ball and not force shots when they are not there this would keep the ball away from robert lewandowski and others additionally this strategy will lead to more quality shots instead of simply firing anything that appears open this difference can be seen plainly in the two matches against montenegro england finished when the teams met the first time thanks in part to holding only percent of possession however they earned a result on friday after controlling the ball for percent the match smart passes and conservative play will help make this difference key on robert lewandowski adam nurkiewicz getty images while poland do have other players capable of scoringjakub blaszczykowskispecifically has had a great tournament and continues to be a solid secondary option behind lewandowski just like on borussia dortmundlewandowski remains the goto option on this attack and poland struggles when he does not get involved he has elite skill with the ball and a knack for being in the right place at the right time when he gets a view of the net he can finish as well as anyone in the world england have to make sure to not allow him any good looks throughout this match the defense must mark him at all times even if it comes at the expense of leaving someone else open you simply cannot allow a player of this caliber to do anything that beats you in this match get daniel sturridge involved ian walton getty images england utilizes one of the better midfields in the world with veterans frank lampard and steven gerrard but the pair has not done a great job of getting the ball to the talent up front wayne rooney has done well in recent matches but he needs help on the attack this is where daniel sturridge can come in the liverpool forward currently leads the english premier league with six goals in seven matches but he has not been seen much for the national team although he scored on a penalty shot late in the last contest he has the skill to help the squad throughout the match considering englands inconsistency on the attack sturridge could provide a lot of help in this key match follow rob goldberg on twitter for the latest breaking news and analysis
2 brazil are finding their rhythm as coach luiz felipe scolari defines his squad for the world cup next year following resounding victories last month against australia and portugal the selecao brasileira traveled to asia for friendlies against south korea and zambia they head home having recorded two straightforward victories scoring four goals and conceding none neymar is increasingly becoming the focal point of scolaris balanced brazilian side just as portugal had done in boston he was the target of repeated fouls and a distinct lack of fair play from both sets of opposition defences against korea the barcelona frontman was fouled on occasions but refused to let the intimidation get to him instead he responded the way he knows best on the stroke of halftime he curled a freekick into the top corner of the net and brazil were on their way oscars goal early in the second half ended the match as a contest and scolari could breathe easy as he continued to test players who have approached these games with complete dedication chung sungjun getty images oscar scored in both games as brazils first xi is virtually defined with so few fifa dates until final squads must be named every player is treating each game as an audition against south korea scolari went with the strongest side he had at his disposal in beijing three days later a far more mixed lineup took to the field in came diego cavalieri dede maxwell lucas leiva lucas moura and alexandre pato in a formation it was the everimproving neymar who again provided the most threat whilst pato was a distinct disappointment at times the ball seemed to be consciously avoiding him as the former ac milan striker continues to struggle for form when fit he offers brazil far more varied options than the more static fred or jo but until he finds form brazil are better equipped with a more reliable goal source zambia parked the bus to borrow a phrase from a wellknown premier league manager and the defence was left with very little to do with ramires paired with paulinho in the centre of midfield the selecao poked and probed but found their opposition stubborn to break down brazil huffed and puffed and finally broke the zambia house down on minutes when oscars longrange shot took a wicked deflection to loop beyond mweene but it was only with the entrance of a trio of scolari regulars that they managed to go ahead at the interval pato lucas moura and ramires had made way for jo oscar and hulk and the deadlock was broken with limited time together it would have been more prudent to allow fringe players more minutes together scolari chased a result and got it but there are no prizes for beating zambia those will only come next year when seven games in days will require the efforts of a squad rather than a first team big phil is now in a position where the starters are virtually confirmed should he have everyone fit for the world cups opening match his selection is likely to run as follows julio cesar daniel alves thiago silva david luiz marcelo luiz gustavo paulinho oscar hulk neymar fred jared wickerham getty images pato did little to show he deserves a place in the world cup squad the remaining positions to fill are squad players who could nevertheless play pivotal roles next year there are some doubts as to his third goalkeeper jefferson who played against south korea will be the no but it was tough to assess cavalieri as he had so little to do three central defendersdede rever and henriquelook to be competing for one spot and dede getting the nod today would indicate he is ahead in the race likewise lucas leiva fernando of shakhtar donetsk and tottenhams sandro are all battling to be brazils secondchoice holding midfielder and if sandro can forge a partnership at club level with paulinho he could make it his further forward scolari has his biggest headache at centreforward jo is a likeforlike replacement for fred and has earned high praise for his performances in the yellow of brazil denis doyle getty images scolari may regret not calling up diego costa today was patos chance and while it would be premature to conclude he blew it definitively he did little to convince he can recapture his early promise of and scolaris decision to ignore atletico madrids diego costa could turn into a huge blow if he does indeed opt to direct his loyalty towards his adopted spain two more victories from two more friendlies have given another confidence boost to brazil the first team is in excellent shape and can rule the world in july scolari must hope there is no sting in the tail of his attacking forces

2 when mesut ozil arrived at arsenal on the final day of the summer transfer window thoughts immediately turned to the tantalizing prospect of his partnership with santi cazorla ozils prolific creative output and cazorlas technical trickery is a dream combination but in typical arsenal luck an injury to cazorla on another needless international junket for spain has meant he is yet to play a game with arsenals record signing fortunately fans wont have to wait long to see ozil and cazorla link up the spaniard has been tellingas that he is close to returning to the first team and could feature this weekend against norwich city via a report from the sport review but exactly how will his partnership with ozil work very well is the answer most are hoping for and indeed anticipating but it will require a certain adaptation for at least one of arsenals primary playmakers after all cazorla spent most of last season as the chief creative force for the gunners he was at his best in the central no role now seemingly reserved for the mercurial ozil that leaves cazorla looking for a new way to fit into the structure of a winning team cazorla must adapt himself to a winning team to many the answer is to simply put cazorla on the left flank he played there during the latter half of the last campaign although opinion was mixed about how successful he was despite the doubters he did produce some matchwinning performances from the left notably in home fixtures against aston villa and wigan athletic cazorla also seems like a natural fit to begin games in a wide berth his quickness close control and dizzying skills with both feet suit the demands of beating markers out wide this is something arsenals sometimes narrow approach has been lacking the absence of true width and trickery was painfully obvious in the gunners recent draw with west bromwich albion but as good as cazorla can be from the left there remains a feeling that arsenal miss his guile in the middle it is a valid point considering manager arsene wengers style of play usually involves arsenal building most of their attacks through the middle the obvious counter to that view is the gunners no longer need cazorla to play centrally they have ozil in that position and he can exert a similar if not greater influence the one problem in that scenario is how much freedom ozil is able to find in the middle one of the criticisms sometimes applied to cazorla is that he can be crowded out in central areas well that same critique applies equally to ozil forcing him backward and swarming around him in numbers was clearly the approach west brom took to corralling ozil the tactic worked very well and ozil was ineffective for large portions of that game one of his main issues is that he is so far too easily powered off the ball that and the number of markers opponents are able to dedicate to him in the middle is why ozil has yet to deliver a truly masterful performance in the english premier league his best display actually came in the uefa champions league against napoli ozil began that game on the left and inspired arsenal to a victory ozil produced his best game so far for arsenal operating from the left flank letting him start from a wider area makes ozil more difficult for opponents to mark they cannot assign central midfielders exclusively to the task or else they risk becoming exposed in the middle when he is wide ozils movement off the flank also becomes harder to track in that sense he becomes similar to arsenal legend robert pires the classy schemer occupied the left flank for years but never played like a true winger instead pires would drift around and rotate positions with forward dennis bergkamp and striker thierry henry pires was deadly whenever he ghosted into central positions as part of a flowing attacking move ozil is certainly capable of posing the same threat starting him on the left puts cazorla back in the middle and that may suit both arsenal and ozil better one of cazorlas best attributes is his scoring potential he was very effective attacking centrally during his first year with the gunners more than just his impressive array of long shots cazorla would often make the late run into the box to latch onto a pass from wide and produce a goal his hattrick in the away win over readingas well as his delightful flick in the home win by the same score over west ham unitedserve as prime examples ozil does not offer the same goal threat granted it is too early in his arsenal career to be dismissing his scoring potential altogether but ozil has historically never been prolific either at club level or internationally but he can certainly provide the supply for a player like cazorla to make the most of finding players for the man often dubbed king of the assist to provide for has been a problem for arsenal since they signed ozil with quick widebreaking forwards lukas podolski and theo walcott still injured ozil does not have many targets cazorlas ability to make late runs and convert scoring chances can be a boost to ozil cazorla would give him a dangerous option to connect with and despite his diminutive stature cazorla would be more use in central midfield where his persistence and intricate trickery often get him out of crowds and away from close marking of course it is important to remember that no positions are fixed in wengers grand design fluidity is the key and both cazorla and ozil can be expected to roam all over the pitch but that is not to say that teams including arsenal sometimes encounter problems when they try and accommodate too many players vying to dominate the same areas that was an issue for wenger when he had cesc fabregas samir nasri and andrei arshavin the latter pair were not always comfortable being forced into wide berths but in truth that is the kind of dilemma a manager ought to welcome and use to his advantage if nothing else it shows strength and depth in a key area of the team for now though the cazorlaozil partnership might work best with ozil starting wide and cazorla working the middle
2 oscar and dede scored the goals as brazil comfortably saw off the challenge of zambia at the beijing national stadium in china in a victory chelsea midfielder oscar gave the south americans a 59thminute lead when his deflected shot looped over zambia goalkeeper kennedy mweene seven minutes later a neymar freekick found defender dede inside the area and he headed home his first international goal it was a solid performance from luiz felipe scolaris team against the africans but the brazilians will need greater challenges as they head toward the world cup finals as the host nation neymar went very close in just the third minute when his freekick from outside the areaforced a great save against the crossbar from mweene dani alves then drove over after a great brazil passing move set up the barcelona defender inside the box in the 15th minute ramires played an excellent onetwo with neymar to create a great opportunity but the chelsea midfielders finish was offtarget the quick feet of neymar took the barcelona man into the area but his fine ball to alexandre pato was missed by the brazilian forward and the chance was lost pato then set up an opportunity for lucas moura with a neat headed knockdown from an alves cross but the shot was well wide of goal brazil were comfortably ahead on points before the halftime break but there also seemed to be a lack of urgency inscolaris team which ensured the score remained goalless mweene needed to be at his best to push away a neymar strike after the barca star danced through the zambia defence into the area in the 53rd minute the darker side of neymar emerged when he fell to the floor after appearing to trip himself up to earn a freekick zambia were left enraged by his actions but the resulting freekick by david luiz was saved well four minutes later though the glittering skills of neymar almost came to fruition when a stunning pass to alves almost saw the defender open the scoring in the 59th minute brazil finally got their breakthrough although luck played a large part after a move between hulk and neymar broke down at a corner zambia could not clear and the ball fell for oscar whose shot from outside the area took a deflection and looped over mweene misfortune again befell zambia for the second goal when a freekick was harshly awarded against the africans after neymar had again down easily near the byline neymar took the set piece himself and defender dede was on hand inside the area to head home for the brazilians oscar should have added a second with minutes remaining but his delicate curling shot from the edge of the area was smothered easily by mweene good play by hulk opened up space for the forward from yards but his effort flew just wide neymarwas replaced by bernard and the substitute produced some trickery before the laying the ball off to maxwell whose shot flew wide ofmweenes goal player gradesneymar azambia appeared to have followed the south korea template for dealing with the mercurial brazil star producing some questionable challenges but neymar still proved to be the most effective brazilian threat on show in china and his early freekick which struck the crossbar was merely an indication of what was to come zambia had little answer for the quick feet of the barcelona man but neymar is still undoing his terrific skills with the less savoury ability to fall down easily under a challenge david luiz awith zambia relatively neutered in attacking threat luiz enjoyed a relatively quiet evening in the birds nest stadium in beijing the chelsea defender offered the occasional attacking foray and went close in the first half but it was a comfortable evening for luiz despite the odd clattering challenge from zambian forwards left the field to be replaced by henrique but a sensible outing for the chelsea man after an excellent display against south korea on saturday ramires bmissed an early opportunity for brazil when he sent the ball wide when oneonone with the zambia goalkeeper the chelsea midfielder was an energetic presence for scolaris team before being switched for stamford bridge teammate oscar at the interval as the manager rotated his team aquestion mark must still remain over his creativity at times but a lack of ambition from the opposition negated a significant need for that emmanuel mayuka cthe southampton forwardshowed flashes of pace and appeared to be zambias greatest threat but mayuka who is currently on loan at sochaux rarely troubled dani alves on the left flank during his time on the pitch man of the matchdani alves brazil the barcelona defender produced a lively display in an otherwise perfunctory brazil display negated the threat of mayuka on the left wing with little difficulty and also offered a significant attacking presence of his own for the south americans alves should have gotten himself on the scoresheetbut lost the ball under his feet after a stunning pass from neymar postmatch reactionzambia coach patrice beaumelleinsisted his team were simply delighted to have the chance to learn from brazil as global timesreported it is a pride for my team we were the under side

4 kyrie irving will be competing for a place among the nbas elite during only his third season with the cleveland cavaliers to contend for allnba honors and prove his worth as a truly legit superstar however irving will need to clear four key hurdles in terms of his individual production while first duplicating the allstar success he achieved in irving will also need to capitalize on the talent around him by increasing his individual assist total beyond that he will now be asked to play through the bumps and bruises that may have been used to sideline him previously in cleveland while also emerging as a competent defender for the cavaliers if he can accomplish that much while working to help cleveland secure a playoff berth irving will finish the year ranked among the nbas top players and remove any doubt regarding the legitimacy of his superstar status moving forward duplicate allstar success nba photos getty images the superstar discussion for irving begins with an assumption of allstar level production again in while thats certainly fair and likely for the point guard who averaged points and assists on percent shooting a year ago it still shouldnt be simply dismissed as anything other than a noteworthy hurdle despite having more talent around him now in cleveland through the additions of jarrett jack earl clark anthony bennett sergey karasev and the prospects of a healthy andrew bynum irving will remain the primary focal point of opposing defenses on a nightly basis he will need to combat a collection of defenders equipped with two years of nba game film highlighting when and where irving likes to attack who are also tasked with the specific goal of slowing him down unlike last season irving will also be competing with a healthy derrick rose a revamped roster around deron williams and other elite guards for one of a few spots on this years eastern conference allstar team while i expect irving to overcome these challenges by increasing his numbers across the board that accomplishment shouldnt be viewed as a mere givenregardless of how easy he makes it look when hes out there increase assist total via espn the allnba team featured three point guardschris paul first team tony parker second team and russell westbrook second team while injuries played a role in preventing players like derrick rose and even rajon rondo from securing that honor this group still represented the elite at the point guard position in addition to the work they each put in scoring the ball paul parker and westbrook each ranked in the top eight among all players in the league with and assists respectively kyrie irving meanwhile finished in a tie for 26th with dimes to be considered a legit nba superstar irving will need to increase his assist total to at least seven per night in order to compare favorably with the elite at his position as opposed to hoping teammates like luke walton convert his assists last year however irving should see his totals improve simply by passing to better more improved players so long as jarrett jack anthony bennett and an improving young core featuring dion waiters and tristan thompson are able to help irving should reach this total as a facilitator with relative ease assists like this lob from half court that irving left for waiters during the cavs preseason matchup with the orlando magic could add up quickly throughout the year play through the bumps and bruises stephen r sylvanieusa today sports with nothing to play for over the last two seasons the cavaliers were extremely cautious in keeping irving out of the lineup based on what seemed at times to be even the remote threat of injury irving was unfairly labeled by some critics who didnt understand the circumstances surrounding the time he missed as injury prone or even soft regardless of how warranted criticisms were then however irving must prove those skeptics wrong by setting a careerhigh in games played this season while every player in the league can only hope to remain healthy throughout the course of an nba grind irving can work to extend his appearances by playing through the bumps and bruises he may not have previously in cleveland figuring to be in contention for a postseason berth the cavs may not have the reasons they once did to ask irving to sit on nights he could potentially play his ability to produce under those circumstances will go a long way to establishing his place among the nbas elite superstars become a competent defender david manningusa today sports nobody is asking kyrie irving to evolve into the second coming of gary payton for the cavaliers under coach mike brown what he will need to become though is a competent defender whos willing to put consistent work in on that side of the ball for irving this means aligning himself in a proper defensive stance as many times as possible on a perpossession basis throughout the season it also means that he must work to put himself in proper position in help side defense as well as pickandroll situations irving wont have to execute flawlessly percent of the time on defense but he will need to continue the commitment and willingness hes demonstrated throughout training camp and make himself accountable defensively if hes able to take that step and eliminate the only real criticism about his game along the way irving will become a complete superstar worthy of all praise and accolades he has coming work toward playoffs in process fernando medina getty images irving doesnt have to technically secure a playoff berth during the campaign in order to prove himself as a legitimate superstar if he is able to duplicate his allstar success by scoring in the 22pointspernight range throughout the year while also increasing his assist total game appearances and defensive production he will have done all he can to help cleveland compete in the process the leadership hes being asked to assume this season would be demonstrated by his desire to improve defensively the hope in cleveland from there would be that his young teammates follow suit by maximizing their respective roles to help irvings brilliance lead them to the postseason but while a playoff trip may put irving over the top in terms of superstardom it wont be required just yet for the for the point guard who doesnt turn until march

4 the houston rockets have had some very intriguing stat lines early on this preseason from players who will have a significant impact on their standing in the western conference during the season as a whole houston has impressed so far after the rockets dropped their preseason opener to the new orleans pelicans head coach kevin mchale led his team to two straight victories over the indiana pacers it may just be the preseason but beating the pacers likely wont be an easy task this season the fact that the rockets beat them twice in a row was impressive the rockets have won with big games from role players off the bench and some surprisingly solid defense along the perimeter dwight howard and omer asik will handle the interior defensively but houstons perimeter defense is still a question mark the intensity early on has been great and maybe that intensity will translate into success when it counts houston is a deep team that doesnt have much room for significant playing time meaning that nearly every player is entrenched in his role aside from the power forward position and the reserve small forward the rockets are as close to set in stone as it can get in the nba the players who have performed well thus far know the roles they must fill and theyve already started to play well their game stat lines so far have been impressive patrick beverley oct vs new orleans pelicans thomas b shea getty images patrick beverley had a great game to start the preseason even if it came in just minutes off the bench he scored a modest points dished out five assists and recorded four steals while he didnt grab a rebound a bit uncharacteristically for him he did fight for the ball several times near the basket beverley was also very efficient turning the ball over just once and shooting a perfect 4for4 from both the field and the freethrow line he missed his only threepoint attempt from deep his line was modest at best but was intriguing given the high number of steals and low number of turnovers in debates this offseasonabout who should start at point guard for the rockets doubters of jeremy lin cited his high amount of turnovers and his propensity to play averageatbest defense on the perimeter beverley was the exact opposite against the pelicans he showed great awareness with the ball and made the smart plays when passing it off in terms of defense the four steals speak for themselves the chances of beverley starting more than games ahead of a healthy lin this season are slim to none regardless his line against the pelicans will give lins doubters even more to think about jeremy lin oct vs indiana pacers neutral site joe murphy getty images lin had quite a game himself in the rockets next contest against the pacers he dropped points with 3of6 shooting and made all eight of this free throw attempts while he did not record a steal or a block he did manage to pick up six rebounds five defensive and five assists for a preseason matchup thats about as complete of a line as you can ask there were some negatives though he turned it over three times and was called for five personal fouls in just minutes of play lin has a lot to prove this season he knows how to learn how to play alongside howard after learning to play with james harden last season and the expectations of him have never been bigger in his career if he cant be the point guard that leads the rockets to the postseason and beyond then general manager daryl morey could eventually look to make a change it will be a process blending three guys together who command the ball wont be easy lin will be the facilitator and distributing the basketball will be up to him if his stat line against the pacers is any indication of how hell play in the early months of the regular season then the rockets should be fine from the start omri casspi oct vs indiana pacers neutral site joe murphy getty images omri casspi has had quite the preseason with his new team but no performance was better than his on oct against the pacers casspi played minutes and scored points he went 5of7 from the field and 2of4 from deep he grabbed nine rebounds eight defensive dished out two assists and turned the ball over just once his stellar line led to a plusminus of plus14 its early but casspi clearly makes this houston team better sure a majority of his minutes have come at times when the opposition is playing its depth off the bench but it still takes some bigtime hustle to grab nine rebounds from the small forward positionnot to even mention the fact that it came in just minutes in a preseason game casspi seems like a great offseason addition by morey through three games what you see is what you get with him hes not stellar offensively but hell get the job done if you leave him open hes not the biggest of guys but hes strong enough to fight his way through traffic and work to grab the ball near the basket overall he has a positive effect on his teammates casspi might only see around

2 england will need more than the fearless direct running of andros townsend to prosper over a wellorganised and talented poland team while the tottenham hotspur winger was the bright spark that lifted and inspired roy hodgsons team against montenegro the midfield duo of frank lampard and steven gerrard remained unconvincing the chelsea and liverpool veterans may finally have found a way to play together after all these years but their newfound understanding comes more through their lack of mobility than an increase in awareness or tactical familiarity michael steele getty images its hardly fair to call it a double pivot which has always been the ultimate dream of every one of their supporters calling for the dysfunctional partnership to be tried once more however the onpaper theory of the two clublevel match winners tempering their attacking tendencies against the other with one sitting back when the other surges forward and vice versa has never come to fruition rather now that they are both unable to bomb forwards lampard and gerrard have begun to sit back and play a more static game covering each other by default but sapping englands midfield of energy introducing a younger player with the legs to run up and down the field alongside one of the two old hands is vital jack wilshere or jordan henderson look ideally suited for such a role if only hodgson could bring himself to trust the respectivearsenal and liverpool prospects hendersons absence from the england squad at all is very peculiar given his form for brendan rodgers team and inability to play for the under21s anymore paul gilham getty images its pointless calling up u21 players who wont get games england should focus on players like townsend its these sorts of players that the national set up so often fail as new starlets such as ross barkley and raheem sterling are promoted from englands youth teams while past graduates are abandoned to the international wilderness worryingly the former sunderland prodigy was included in hodgsons euro squad at a time when his club performances were often dire now that hes in good form and a litter older hes being overlooked outshinedby new youthful flavours of the month perhaps its time that england made better use of the players coming through in their early 20s rather than continuing to strip gareth southgates u21 team of their best players after all its unlikely barkley and co will be receiving any real amount of game time in the senior squad alex livesey getty images now that jordan henderson deserves a cap hes nowhere near the england squad andros townsend shows what can happen when a player from this missing age group is given a proper chance for england and his impact against montenegro will hopefully encourage hodgson to see him as a model for further injections of youth into his team the alternative is to fall back on the tried tested and mediocre solutions that unfortunately seem highly likely adam nurkiewicz getty images lewandowski will be hoping polands fans can bring the noise at wembley it wouldnt be a shock to see townsend benched to play poland with james milner returned to the first team as a defensive wide midfielder rather than an attacking winger while it would be a surprise if lampard and gerrard are broken up in the middle having already talked up the chances of robert lewandowski and his countrymen as they head to wembley with fans per the telegraph england fans will hope hodgson isnt once again seeking to manage expectations should lampard and gerrard be played together for england yes experience is key regardless of their ageing legs no theyve never been a natural partnership and now theyre past it too submit votevote to see resultsshould lampard and gerrard be played together for england yes experience is key regardless of their ageing legs 24 no theyve never been a natural partnership and now theyre past it too 76 total votes if br polldata br polldata if br polldata br polldata id question should lampard and gerrard be played together for england choices choice0 count choice yes experience is key regardless of their ageing legs choice6 count choice choice1 count choice no theyve never been a natural partnership and now theyre past it too choice7 count choice choice2 count choice choice8 count choice choice3 count choice choice9 count choice choice4 count choice choice5 count choice sidebar false if br poll br poll showresults false

2 arsenal midfielder jack wilshere is set to return to the england starting lineup on tuesday night in place of chelseas frank lampard according to the daily stars david woods wilshere sat out the three lions win over montenegro on friday evening with lampard partnering captain steven gerrard in the centre of the england midfield exclusive jack wilshere is back for england tonight http t co mpu6gxkxyt daily star daily star october 2013lampard was replaced by michael carrick after minutes of that encounter and while the same switch is an option once more woods reports that it is wilshere whom hodgson will turn to on this occasion boss roy hodgson will keep his men guessing until lunchtime before naming his starting xi for tonights crunch clash with poland but lampard is expected to drop to the bench while phil jones looks to be hodgsons pick to replace the suspended kyle walker at right back englands midfield has been the topic of much debate in recent months with hodgsons side yet to consistently strike the right balance in the centre of the park at present the best english midfielder of the past two premier league seasonscarrickis sidelined while the decision to revert to a lampard and gerrard combination against montenegro says much of wilsheres mediocre form lampard and gerrard have played together times for england there must be no 60th johnbrewinespn explains why http t co kqjw6fslkf espn co uk espnuk october 2013indeed the arsenal player has been capturing the headlines far more for his offthepitch antics than his performances on the field including the latest incident on monday when he was caught relieving himself at the side of englands training pitch by television cameras according to david kent of the daily mail with tom cleverley and alex oxladechamberlain injured though hodgsons options are limited and woods reports that he will opt for wilshere over carrick to control the midfield with the latter seen as too defensive hodgson of course has come in for much criticism for his lack of adventure since taking the england job and in turn won much praise for his boldness on friday in selecting andros townsend as an attacking option on the right flank with hodgson perhaps worried of appearing too cautious the suggestion is carrick is the unlucky party and wilsheres more energetic style of midfield play is preferred if england are struggling to control the tempo of the game however it would be little surprise to see the manchester united man introduced early in the second half once more to tidy up matters in the centre of midfield
4 the sacramento kings have been searching for a franchise player since chris webber was traded to the philadelphia 76ers in demarcus cousins has more than enough talent to become that franchise player but still has a few things he needs to work on before becoming the cornerstone player the kings need before breaking down cousins game the most glaring need for the diminutive center is to adjust his attitude cousins has routinely clashed with management coaches and teammates in just before christmas cousins got into an argument at halftime of a game with his head coach keith smart the kings decided to suspend cousins immediately after the game to his credit cousins admitted his wrong doing what happens in the locker room stays in the locker room but i was wrong i was wrong said cousins who scored nine points in minutes im a player that definitely wants to win every night and im an emotional player thats never going to change but i shouldnt have responded back something was said and i just should have stayed quiet is it a humbling thing yeah i will say that i mean i messed up and i apologize to my teammates for responding the way i did and ill move on from it cousins fiery attitude and immature actions were also on display the previous month in a november game against the san antonio spurs the league suspended cousins for confronting spurs announcer sean elliot in a hostile manner cousins talent is undeniable which is why the new kings ownership rewarded him with a fouryear maximum contract extension in september however the attitude and potential must align with his production on the court if the kings are ever going to climb out of the doldrums of the western conference offensive checklistdemarcus cousins is an absolute monster on the block his size athleticism and ability to score on the block are elite not many players in the league can guard cousins oneonone down low even fewer have his talent to score through contact however much like his attitude his offensive game drives you crazy at times for as well as he can score in the paint cousins shoots far too many midrange jumpers according to hoopdata cousins attempted shots per game from zerotonine feet meanwhile cousins attempted shots from 10to23 feet while cousins has good form on his shot and a lot of potential to develop his jumper he is clearly better off scoring around the rim the kentucky product recorded a careerhigh fieldgoal percentage last season this is largely due to him shooting a stellar percent at the rim as can be seen in the shot chart graphic from nba com stats cousins attempted far too many midrange jumpers while he shot above league averagedark bluefrom the left wing cousins was below average in the rest of the targeted areas additionally cousins attempted percent of his shots from those below average midrange areas cousins can easily improve his scoring output and efficiency by redistributing a portion of those shots into the paint defensive checklistfor all of his athletic gifts cousins is a relatively weak defender his length size and athleticism should allow him to become a solid defensive center unfortunately the kings were two points better per possessions with cousins off the floor according to 82games furthermore cousins gave up a per of to opposing centers nearly eliminating his offensive contribution resulting in a net positive1 per for example watch how cousins defends his man on both plays in this clip the first play cousins allows his man to gain solid position on the block cousins does not try to push his man off the block but simply allows him to catch the entry pass without any pressure next cousins does not establish a wide base or breakdown into a defensive stance his feet are narrow his hands are at his side and his defender beats him to his spot to complicate things even more cousins commits a silly foul as his man attempts a shot the second play of the clip cousins does break down and pressure the ball at the elbow unfortunately he gets too far into his man and is not ready to play him off the dribble this time cousins avoids a reaching foul but allows his man to blow right past him and forces the defense to break down and collapse the final clip is one of pure noneffort cousins gets back in transition and he is put into a pickandroll set cousins does the right thing by trying to hedge and cut off ricky rubio but he does so lackadaisically his hedge is lazy he is out of his defensive stance and he overcommits allowing rubio to come off the pick without any discomfort as a result cousins is left at half court the defense collapses and minnesota scores easily six seconds into the shot clock overall cousins is on the verge of stardom but he can quickly go either way adjusting his attitude and buying into his head coach would go a long way towards correcting some of his problems and alleviating some of the kings fears about him offensively his shot selection needs to improve this will not only make him more difficult to defend but will make it easier for his teammates to score around him defensively cousins needs to put in more effort he is capable of being a solid defender but his effort level needs to match his talent level on that end make no mistake cousins is one of the best young bigs in the entire league however his natural talent when paired with consistent effort could propel him into stardom cousins needs to adjust his attitude and buy into whatever system his coach plans to install when he finally combines his talents effort and mental

2 spain need just a solitary point to clinch a place in the world cup in spain and against a georgian side that has won just one of seven qualifiers it certainly seems like a simple enough feat for the defending champions oh and spain also havent lost in consecutive world cup qualifiers so a draw seems all but assured with more than enough star power to earn a win against far more talented sides than georgia spain will hope for a more comfortable result than their victory over belarus on friday evening lets break this contest down when tuesday october at p m et p m bst where estadio carlos belmonte albacete spainwatch espn deportes watchespn bt sport uk key storylines david ramos getty images while the spanish midfield is absolutely loaded with talent filling out the lone forward spot atop the countrys favored formation has remained vexing for a few years now players such as alvaro negredo fernando torres david villa fernando llorente roberto soldado michu and diego costa are all competing forvicente del bosques affection as negredo told espn taking advantage of any opportunities given is important with so much competition for the position its very tough in the national team there are a lot of good players so when we go out on the pitch we give it everything and sometimes things go well and sometimes they dont as strikers we live for goals in the last game against belarus i was fortunate enough to get on the pitchand score the second on other days things dont go so well you need to take advantage of the minutes you get because the competition is tough if torres and villa miss this contest due to injuryand if del bosque decides to go in a different direction after michu failed to make much of an impression againstbelarusnegredo could have his shot on tuesday speaking ofdel bosque the spanish manager wasnt pleased with his teams ambition against belarus and wants to see it improve against georgia via espn the game had the script we expectedall our opponents play the same way we werent able to break them down but the important thing is that we won and we are closer to our objective we wanted to play deeper down the wings but when we scored we adopted a conservative spirit and it was to our detriment i think that we should have tried to be more ambitious with an automatic qualifying place on the line its hard to imagine spain showing less ambition than they did against belarus prediction david ramos getty images spain are more talented deeper at home and playing for actual stakes unlike georgia who will simply be looking to end their qualifying campaign on a positive note the question doesnt seem to be whether the spaniards will win or not but by how much expect this one to be over early on and the home side to take the air out of this game with their favored style of possession football spain wins

4 russell westbrook pretty definitively proved his value in last years playoffs but if any doubts do still remain theyll almost certainly be dispelled by the time westbrook returns to the court westbrook is scheduled to miss the first four to six weeks of the season per nba com that puts his return anywhere from late november to middecember and if you take a quick look at the schedule youll see that the oklahoma city thunder should be able to stay afloat something like wins out of their first games sounds reasonable if a little optimistic dont let a decent total in the win column fool you though unless the thunder have completely overhauled their offense theres a pretty decent chance that the elite defensive teams they face in those or so games the san antonio spurs indiana pacers washington wizards etc absolutely smother them with westbrook out westbrooks absence shed light on something that was long known but previously never a problem the thunder have a stagnant offensive system thats almost entirely reliant upon the individual efforts of westbrook and kevin durant grantlands zach lowe did an excellent breakdown of the okc offense recently writing westbrooks injuries exposed oklahoma citys offense for what it has always been in this era a stagnant collection of four or five set pieces with nothing behind them no counters no constant motion few bits of exciting improvisation any halfway smart team could sniff out what was coming by the time the ball crossed midcourt and if those set pieces failed the thunder would fall back on something even simpler a oneonone play for durant or westbrook or perhaps a semiimprovised pickandroll as the other players stood around to be fair whether or not this offensive system is a serious problem for okc is up for debate theres no doubt that its extremely inefficient without westbrook well get to that but the thunder steamrolled the league in the regular season and were very efficient in the two postseason games westbrook played in per nba com only the miami heat have really stymied the thunder over the past few years and even they havent shut them down by any means ronald martinez getty images only the miami heat have really been able to slow the thunder offense okc scored at a topfive rate against miami in the nba finals a series in which james harden played terribly and at a lowerbut still around leagueaveragerate in the two games they played last season the real problem is that miami has averaged over points per possessions against okc per nba com still more misdirection and moving pieces would be nice and with westbrook out theyre necessary additions funnily enough the no thing westbrook brings to the table is also what hes criticized most forhis aggression westbrook is always in attack mode always ready to barrel into the lane or pull the trigger on a 15footer in fairness to the critics that is sometimes a problem westbrook takes a few bad shots each gamea fartootough layup in traffic or a midrange jumper when better options are available last season westbrook posted a true shooting percentage and of the leagues top scorers only lamarcus aldridge was less efficient but its important not to let that obscure the bigger picture more often than not westbrooks constant aggression is a blessing hes one of maybe five or six players who puts a defense on its heels every time he touches the ball westbrook put up shots at the rim last season third in the league per nba com the only other guard to even sniff the top was harden thats incredibly valuable maybe the best example of this comes from arguably westbrooks best gamehis 43point outburst in game of the nba finals this particular play starts with westbrook handling the ball on the wing and durant close to the top of the key with shane battier on him durant drops further back behind the threepoint line battier follows leaving dwyane wade isolated on westbrook westbrookwhos been killing every single defender hes faced with pullup jumpers and lefty drivesbegins to head left as serge ibaka sets a screen that alone is enough to cause battier to leave durant and collapse into the paint westbrook makes an easy pass to durant battier tries to recover but its too latedurant hits a threepointer to give okc the lead another example comes from game of the same series westbrook did so much damage off the dribble in that game that in this case three heat defenders tried to wall him off as he drove to the basket leaving kendrick perkins open for an easy dunk maybe it goes without saying but these are not routine plays durant is not often left open at the threepoint line and it usually doesnt take three guys to prevent a guard from driving to the basket these plays are westbrookspecific its just him causing havoc in opposing defenses as he does on a nightly basis believe it not though the thunder may miss westbrooks offball presence even more than his playmaking ill preface all that by saying westbrooks replacement reggie jackson is going to be an outstanding player maybe as soon as this year last season he was a killer pickandroll guard who hit an absurd percent of his shots around the rim and hes looked dynamite in the preseason butand its a big buthe shot percent from three and right now defenses dont have to respect him off the ball thats a huge problem for the thunder who already have two players defenses dont really respect in perkins and thabo sefolosha perkins is a nobrainer though sefolosha hit percent of his threes last season hes also a bit gunshy sefolosha generally only shoots when hes wide open and while thats certainly good from an efficiency standpoint it also means defenders can get away with cheating off him he averaged a reasonable threepoint attempts per minutes but that equated to just total attempts thirdfewest of any elite volume threepoint shooter the fact that defenses can blatantly play off of two members of the thunder offense is a problem with westbrook and a disaster when hes out the memphis grizzlies were rarely punished for throwing multiple guys at durant and all too often one of the thunders offensive sets was blown up because one of jackson sefolosha or perkins defenders wasnt where he was supposed to be durant made a huge leap as a playmaker last season and hell be able to punish some of that defensive roaming with savvy passes but even so okc will really miss westbrook who could never be left unchecked even off the ball westbrooks a great cutter despite his reputation hes a pretty good spotup shooter last season he hit percent of his spotup threes and a whopping percent when he was coming off screens though he shot just of them per synergy sports technology westbrook hijacks his overall percentages with some poor offthedribble threes but he can actually shoot and defenders can never ignore him this isnt the kind of stuff that belowaverage defenses can take full advantage of because durant is good enough to shred those teams on his own but as mentioned earlier elite defenses are going to make life very difficult for the westbrookless thunder barring a lot more misdirection and offball movement fortunately for the thunder their defense shouldnt take much of a hit in westbrooks absence jackson has all the tools to be a solid defender and westbrooks defenseparticularly off the ballhas never been all that great okc will miss the occasional big play he sometimes makes in the passing lanes but overall itll still be a stellar defensive team particularly if ibaka continues to improve westbrook may have some flaws but hes an offensive machine and defenses have to be aware of where he is and what hes doing at all times that has very real value especially in the type of offensive system okc runs the thunder should survive the seasons opening stretch but dont be shocked if they really struggle at times they are missing one of the best players in the world after all all stats

4 utah jazz fans were anticipating a rough season in and that was before news surfaced that trey burkes broken finger will require surgery jody genessy of thedeseret newsis reporting that the injury burke sustained to his shooting hand is going to keep him out for eight to weeks he wrote that could leave the jazzs starting point guard sidelined anywhere from to games burkes absence puts the jazz in an interesting situation the team traded two firstround picks in this past summers draft to move up and take the former michigan wolverine ninth overall that in combination with the fact that the jazz signed only john lucas iii during free agency was a clear indication that burke is utahs point guard of the future adding another player at the position might bring some competition to the rotation and by extension confusion for burke but given the maturity that helped him earn five national player of the year awards thats a small risk and there are a couple of players out there who may yield a high reward one such option could be chicagos marquis teaguewho is reportedly someone utah might be interested in according to espns marc stein hearing utah has previously shown trade interest in bulls marquis teague and could well revisit interest depending on trey burke timetable marc stein espnsteinline october 2013physically teague is intriguing he measured a wingspan just over and a vertical leap of inches at the combine but other than that theres not much even with derrick rose out all season in teague made it on the floor for just games and averaged points in minutes for the bulls a better lowrisk highreward option would be sacramentos jimmer fredette the kings threepoint specialist hit percent of his threepoint attempts last season and could provide valuable spacing playing off the ball while gordon hayward handles the offense as a point forward and if he doesnt fit utah can simply let him go next summer because hes on the last year of his rookie contract something im sure jimmer detractors would be betting on for the two or three of you who are familiar with my work at bleacher report over the last three years it should come as no surprise that id take the odds on that one a jimmeronthejazz experiment would work for a few reasons and at this point in his career he could be pretty easy to acquire the kings bailed on jimmer at about the same time they bailed on his first coach seven games into the former byu cougars nba career paul westphal was fired jimmers future has been in flux ever since the winner of every notable player of the year award captured the hearts of millions of americans that year but could never find his way into keith smarts now hes no higher than third on the kings depth chart at two positionspoint guard and shooting guard and back in august sacramento kings beat writer jason jones told ksls tom kirkland that the team was shopping jimmer and utah could put together a couple intriguing packages possible dealsi ran both these possibilities through espns nba trade machine to make sure theyd be allowed under league rules deal no jimmer fredette for jeremy evansdeal no jimmer fredette and chuck hayes for andris biedrinswhy it works for sacramento rocky widner getty images the kings recently announced that carl landry will be out three to four months due to hip surgery and could be looking for some depth inside swapping one of their many guards for an athletic forward makes sense evans is and as evidenced by his dunk contest win he can fly hes also shown an improved midrange jump shot during training camp the second potential deal would give sacramento a little more financial flexibility by swapping the two years left on hayes deal for biedrins expiring contract why it works for utahadding jimmer would bring even more excitement to utah without foiling the other plans the team has already made fredette still has scores of fans in utah who would rush to online ticket outlets for seats and local stores for jerseys the minute they heard of a deal landing jimmer on the jazz and on top of the economic boost it would be a good basketball fit too his prowess as a threepoint specialist has become common knowledge and his range would do a lot to make things easier for his jazz teammates players defending jimmer would never be able to leave him alone on the perimeter to go doubleteam enes kanter or derrick favors theyd also be unwise to slide over in an effort to impede a drive by alec burks or hayward he also has the ability to create plays for others what a lot of people seem to have forgotten about jimmer is how well he can handle the ball just ask his current teammate demarcus cousins who once beamed jimmer got moves dog ethan miller getty images in a game against san diego state jimmer put those moves on display to the tune of points the way he torched current nba defensive specialist kawhi leonard in that game is the reason i picked it out of the many offensive showcases from his college career so on that end of the floor its a nobrainer thequestion on jimmer is now and always has been can he defend what it should be is will he the physical tools that make it possible for him to dominate the way he did offensively in college are the same ones required to play defense he just hasnt utilized them to the same degree on that end defense is about desire look no further than the raptors tyler hansbrough for evidence of that he looks at his man as if he just found out the guy kidnapped his mother and he follows him around like the detective on

4 with russell westbrook set to miss at least the first month of the season and no other reliable scoring threats to support kevin durant the oklahoma city thunder have decided to see if they can squeeze even more production out of their 25yearold superstar so in addition to leading the team in scoring durant is going to be a primary facilitator this year too according to darnell mayberry ofthe oklahoman the change is already underway if you can go back and watch the thunders preseason game against philadelphia pay close attention to kevin durant watch the way he handled the ball controlled the pace picked apart the defense and made plays with his passing you need to see what durant did in that game to understand what the thunders offense very likely will look like to start the season well thats what the thunders offense will look like if it gets to play the lowly philadelphia 76ers times this year against a more even slate of competition durant might find it difficult to match the dimes he accumulated in the game mayberry described still kd averaged a careerhigh helpers per contest last season and hes always going to draw the kind of defensive attention that leaves others open so if the thunder really are serious about giving durant more offensive responsibilities its possible that well see kd lead the team in both scoring and assists this year could it really happen spruce derdenusa today sports there are a handful of caveats to consider here not the least of which is westbrooks health if okcs point guard misses so much of the season that he fails to qualify for the teams assist lead durant would take the title by default no disrespect to reggie jackson the man wholl be starting in westbrooks place but its not like okc has another capable distributor on the roster but by all accounts westbrook is supposed to be back sometime before christmas which means hed have to be playing at a markedly reduced level of effectiveness for durant to finish with a higher pergame assist average for all the criticisms of westbrooks point guard skills its worth mentioning that the lowest singleseason assist rate he has ever posted percent is still higher than kds career high of percent last season per nba com and remember okcs offense was just a hair worse than the miami heats last season but still good enough for second best in the league per nba com much of the teams scoring success came from a more even distribution of touches between westbrook and durant with both looking to score and facilitate so if westbrook is physically able to play the role he did a year ago the thunder are most likely going to return to a more even twopronged attack that will make it tough for durant to accumulate more assists than his star teammate then again maybe theres another scenario in play that could allow durant to retain his new role even if westbrook is healthy layne murdoch jr getty images if scott brooks believes that the thunder could actually improve as an offense by moving westbrook off the ball more frequently maybe well see durant hold on to his new position even if his sidekick is at full strength its undeniably intriguing to imagine westbrook darting around the floor as a cutter attacking as a slasher and generally wreaking havoc with his athleticism the thunder had to teach westbrook how to pass the ball but hes always been a devastating natural scorer the complaints about his shot selection and tunnel vision have quieted but theyve never completely gone away maybe westbrook was never meant to be a point guard in the first place perhaps okc can get more value efficiency and production from its point guard if it turns him loose as a scorer rather than a passer if the thunder are willing to take the risk of drastically redefining the roles of their two best players its possible that durant could thrive as a dual threat while westbrook functions as a singleminded bucketgetter should it happen layne murdoch getty images this is the bigger question and the one that gets closer to the heart of what kind of player durant should ultimately become its cliche to say so but durant isnt lebron james the former is a born scorer with the ability to set others up when necessary while the latter would happily go an entire game without taking a shot both kd and lbj have gradually embraced a whatever it takes approach that has led to more wellrounded games but their basketball dna is as different as can be for now perhaps it makes sense to lean on durant as a distributor as well as a scorer but what okc should do to set itself up for longterm success is put together a roster that allows durant to take even more shots than he already does the fact that the thunder are asking so much of him is both a testament to his remarkable skills and an indictment of general manager sam prestis equally remarkable failure to surround kd with useful offensive players russ isabellausa today sports right now the thunder have two startersthabo sefolosha and kendrick perkinswho depend entirely on other players creativity for their shots and serge ibaka couldnt get his own looks if his life depended on it this is a roster that already asked far too much of durant and westbrook and now that westbrook is hurt durant is shouldering a doubly heavy burden if okc ever wants to be more than a fringe contender which by the way is the best it can hope for this year presti has to find players who can not only get their own shots but also devote their offensive energy to getting looks for durant kd has never played with a legitimate facilitator of any real quality and because of that we probably still havent seen how great a scorer he can be for now the thunder have little choice but to lean on durant to score for himself and to generate chances for everyone else but he shouldnt be viewed as a longterm answer in that role be careful what you wish for usa today sports durant probably could lead the thunder in scoring and assists this yearprovided the circumstances are right but thats not what the thunder need and its not the best thing for kds individual development remember we got a preview of how defenses could attack durant when he had to take on a dual role last year the memphis grizzlies obliterated okcs offense focusing solely on durant making him give up the ball and daring anyone else to make a shot the thunder had no answers defenses already bear down on durant with unparalleled intensity and instead of liberating him by surrounding him with other capable setup artists okc is going to add to his duties thats fine in a pinch but if kd really does wind up leading the thunder in scoring and assists itll probably mean the team has had a rough year and it should probably make kd wonder about how many more he wants to spend in oklahoma city
4 the miami heat dominated the regular season last year with wins and finished it off with a championship run that ended with a game victory over a distraught san antonio spurs team so why cant they have the common decency to at least give the preseason to their opponents its not enough that theyre a year removed from winning games and a second consecutive championship but a threegame winning streak to start the season now theyre just being selfish the heat have opened the preseason with a win over theatlanta hawks as well as a pair of wins on a backtoback against the detroit pistonsand charlotte bobcats dwyane wademissed two of those games lebron james shot a combined 5of15 in the first two and ray allen went 3of19 overall miami has been propped up by the other member of its big three and some unexpected contributors off the bench everybody but the usual suspects has been thriving for the heat early on in the preseason including a pair of roster hopefuls its a great sign for the heat to be winning games without the help of their two largest influences even if it may be occurring in the preseason with the departure of mike miller and the need for there to be less energy wasted on the regular season its a priority for the heat this season to receive far larger contributions from their bench thats exactly what theyve been receiving several roster hopefuls and players with pressure being put on them to perform more than usual this season have all stepped up to the plate each displaying himself in enhanced positions and roles that could actually impact the rotations of the looming regular season with james and wade backing off and allowing others to increase their roles we take a look at three players in particular who have met the challenge chris boshwades recovering and that means its time for the heat to experiment with chris bosh as their secondary scoring option rarely have the heat employed bosh in such a role although hes had his moments hes mainly been perceived in the offense as a complementary piece rather than the allstar he is instead of allowing him to utilize his full repertoire the heat have reduced bosh to the role of a shooter using him to create space and take his defender out of the paint the first two games of the preseason however have featured bosh as a primary option at times he debuted with points on 7of8 shooting in only minutes while also converting his lone threepoint attempt and making all six of his free throws in the preseason opener against atlanta his performance against detroit in the following game was what really opened some eyes going against one of the leagues better and more intimidating defenders in andre drummond bosh repeatedly made the secondyear center look foolish with his consistent pullup game and his ability to get to the basket bosh finished with points on only attempts made his only threepointer and got to the line for four attempts in minutes seconds of action leading the heat to a victory over a pistons team equipped with a formidable frontcourt his recent sevenpoint sevenshot performance against charlottecame in a lowscoring win where lebron led the heat with still the message was sent that bosh is capable of consistently putting up points when hes given the chance the sudden increase in boshs workload comes during wades recovery from a knee injury he suffered late in last years regular season wade has played once in miamis first three preseason games and lebron appears to be still getting his legs back leaving bosh in a situation where he can finally play a role reminiscent of the one he had in toronto since recording a usage rate as high as percent in his final year with the raptors his recent usage rate of percent was the lowest of his heat tenure hes easily been the most impressive player for the heat thus far hes displaying all the signs of a player whos nearing a possible contract year as well as of the player we know hes capable of becoming when given the chance the obvious problem is wade and james dominate the ball and if theyre not scoring they kick it out to the open shooter since it is a contract year and since the coaching staff will want to monitor wades minutes this could be the season miami finally rewards bosh with the role hes deserved judging from the early portion of the preseason miami could be debuting a hierarchy that we have never seen before michael beasleyhow long did it take michael beasley to make an asinine play that would further push the idea that he will never thrive in this league a little less than minutes in his redebut for the heat beasley made highlight reels when he was caught repeatedly punching himself in the head following a traveling violation it was later revealed beasley needed medical attention for a swollen eyebrow but the heat claimed that it came from an inadvertent elbow while the nba world was once again ridiculing beasley his respectable performance was swept under the rug he scored nine points on five shots grabbed two rebounds had an assist and blocked a shot in only nine minutes seconds worth of action he scored in a variety of ways attacking the rim and hitting jumpers he was basically doing the things weve all expected him to do since he was drafted second overall in beasley proved the performance was no fluke in his next game when he played minutes and recorded points on 5of11 shooting to go along with five rebounds he made one of his three threepoint attempts and got to the line for four attempts he attempted nine combined free throws in his two appearances its inspiring that beasley is pouring his heart into this even if he does reveal it by way of inflicting damage upon his own cranium whats more important however is what beasley can provide for the second unit on a heat team with nothing but veteran shooters coming off the bench beasley is a change of pace outside of norris cole hes one of the few players who can come off the bench and consistently create their own shots beasley hasnt exactly lived up to expectations and dont expect that to happen here but its now not necessary for him to play a large role in the rotation which takes some of the pressure off of what he needs to provide in fact its still in doubt where exactly beasley will fit in the rotation miamis bench is as deep as its ever been with beasley roger mason jr and greg oden now on board and its leaving the coaching staff with questions to answer the staff must nowfind a way to incorporate beasley in the rotation because its apparent he can give the heat something theyve never had before off their bench if the heat can get points and five rebounds out of beasley on a consistent basis its a significant win for them with no expectations weighing him down and being in an environment that will only aid any situation that arises the heat may have stumbled upon their latest diamond in the rough roger mason jr it was revealed recently that roger mason jr was actually stolen away from the chicago bulls via recruiting fromray allen quietly the heat just added another veteran shooter with mason expected to take one of the final two roster spots the percent career threepoint shooter was offered a nonguaranteed deal by the heat a few weeks before training camp the lack of interest in mason follows a year where he played in games starting in for thenew orleans hornets and shot percent from the land of three mason now joins a plethora of heat shooters on the bench those shooters already included allen lewis and jones as well as battier norris cole mario chalmers chris bosh and lebron james each one of those players is absolutely lethal from beyond the arc and its no wonder why miami was one of the leagues best threepointshooting teams last year in the only game hes played for miami thus far a sore quad has kept him out the past two games mason showcased a surprising amount of versatility on top of his shooting ability he made three of his four threepoint attempts with the only miss being a tease to finish with points but it was his six rebounds and four assists that really caught the eye of the coaching staff the mason can also contribute on the defensive end hes just another weapon in the deep arsenal of the heat bench as stated before mason being added to the bench fills out a roster that may be the deepest in the league with as little movement as miami made this offseason it still managed to replace mike miller juwan howard and jarvis varnado with greg oden michael beasley and roger mason there are players on this roster who can contribute on any given night its the first time thats been possible in the three years of big three basketball
4 the new york knicks have several players fighting to make the rotation and at least eight players vying for as many as three spots on the roster three such players have stood out during the first two weeks of training camp tim hardaway jr new yorks firstround pick in the draft tim hardaway jr was pegged near the bottom of the depth chart on a team replete with veteran point guards and wing men but the university of michigan product has earned meaningful minutes with his impressive twoway play in the knicks first three preseason games coach woodson praised the rookie after the knicks victory over the boston celtics on october 9th hes going to be in the rotation hell play some said woodson via marc berman of nypost com hardaway scored points in that game on 6for10 shooting including 3for5 from downtown in minutes of play he knocked down a 20foot jumper along the baseline with eight seconds left to win the game the rookie followed that up points on 5for11 shooting including 3for8 from behind the arc in minutes against the toronto raptors on october 11th then he struggled the following night against the boston celtics shooting 3for16 for nine points those ups and downs are to be expected by a firstyear player preseason performances should be taken with a grain of salt players are not at the top of their gameas they work their way back into shape and are often acclimating themselves to new teammates and or a new system some of hardaways success came against guys who will not make the roster or will be glued to the end of the bench however through his shotmaking commitment to defense and poise under pressure hardaway demonstrated that he is ready to contribute immediately at he has good size for his position and his ability to run the floor as seen in the clip below from the raptors game is particularly valuable for a team full of aging veterans ike dioguthe knicks have plenty of depth in the backcourt and on the wing and according to ian begley of espnnewyork com mike woodson suggested early in training camp that he would probably keep at least one big man from the group of roster invitees without guaranteed contracts woody says hes comfortable w what knicks have on perimeter made it sound as if they may keep or more of the bigs on training camp deals ian begley ianbegley october 2013power forwards josh powell ike diogu jeremy tyler whose contract is partially guaranteed and center cole aldrich are in the mix tyler appeared to have the inside track on a roster spot after playing inspired basketball for the knicks summer league team butsurgery on his right footin september hurt his chances of making the team tyler will likely miss all of training camp and is not expected back until november powell has done nothing to impress the coaching staff in limited preseason action aldrich the only true center of bunch grabbed five boards in minutes and defended the pickandroll well in the knicks first preseason game according to alan hahn of msg network the former lottery pick also impressed coaches in practice cole aldrich impressed the coaching staff in practice and in the preseason opener so he got an early look here didnt last long alan hahn alanhahn october 2013the center was the first big man off the bench for the knicks against the raptors but was pulled after just five minutes for his poor defensive footwork in the paint since then the praise has turned to criticism according to marc berman of nypost com woodson questioned aldrichs toughness woodson calls out center cole aldrich for not being tougher as former kansas lottery picks stock dropping http t co ncwlzfjsfp marc berman nypost berman october 2013al innazzone of newsday com reported that knicks general manager steve mills indicated that new york is looking for a backup center mills also said at this point if the knicks need anything its a backup center al iannazzone al iannazzone october 2013diogu is generally considered an undersized power forward at though he is very physical and has a wingspan after receiving minimal playing time in the knicks first two preseason games he staked his claim for a roster spot with points and eight rebounds in minutes against the celtics on october 12th diogu has bounced around the league since the golden state warriors selected him with the ninth pick in the draft he played in puerto rico last season the power forward has tremendous lowerbody strength which he uses to establish and maintain position in the post on both ends of the floor but his lack of foot speed has made him a liability on defense that could be his undoing in the eyes of mike woodson yet if diogu continues to perform the way he did against the celtics he should find himself on the knicks roster when the season begins toure murrytoure murry had a solid rookie season in the developmental league averaging9 ppg rpg apg and spg over games for the red valley vipers after going undrafted out of wichita state university in the combo guard impressed knicks coaches during the summer in las vegas with his ball pressure and nifty passes like the one below murry accepted an invitation to the knicks training camp despite an uphill battle to make the team due to a logjam at both guard spots the former shocker did not see any action in the first preseason game and scored just two points in nine minutes against the raptors he finally got an extended run the following night against the celtics and made the most of it scoring points in minutes on 8for21 shooting he also chipped in four rebounds two assists and a steal yet it is murrys defense that provides him with the best chance of making the team at he possesses the size and quickness to defend both guard positions opposing point guards shredded the knicks defense on pickandrolls last season and the addition of veteran point guard beno udrih will not improve the situation murry is quicker laterally than udrih raymond felton and pablo prigioni and woodson could use him in short spurts to stifle the opponents attack

step up to inclusion in the senior squad look further down the ranks and the same progression is apparent suso gerard deulofeu oliver torres and jose campana were all part of spains squad at the fifa under20 world cup this summer all four featured on monday night in spains win over hungary at under21 level quality of facilities succession of challengesto aid in this progression through the ranks of the spain squad a number of key factors are maintained as constants for the spanish football federation first and foremost the coaches of the country who are involved at professional level are to be blunt professional the nation is host to more than coaches who have gained uefa a level qualification and more than atuefa pro licence level those numbers far exceed both england and germany coaching standards are high emphasis on player ability as well as mentality is high and they are demanding on and off the field an international players timetable is rigorously set out and he is expected to stick to it while representing his nation no matter whether in the senior squad or the under20s in spain unlike many other countries the national teams do not have one home ground the national team have played their qualifying matches for the world cup in madrid mallorca gijon and albacete similarly the under21s are getting a grounding in touring the country becoming accustomed to playing in different settings different arenas in front of different crowds pinatararena com for their doubleheader against bosniaherzegovina and hungary in the region of murcia they trained at the brandnew pinatar arena football centre which has hosted the likes of borussia dortmund almeria real valladolid and the spanish international womens team such highclass facilities are not only expected for the nations best budding talent but also actively encouraged the two games took place at professional stadiumsreal murcia and cartagenaaround a 30minute drive from their training base giving the younger players as close to an exact replica of the situation faced at senior international level as possible under21 challengeswhile not all new senior internationals arrive fresh off the press from the under21snewly capped forward michu being the best examplethere is no doubt that turning promising youngsters into fully fledged worldclass athletes is the best route to sustained glory its also one of the hardest steps to take in football just as at club level many talented reserve players do not take that final step to becoming a firstteam player so do many youthful prospects fail to turn a dozen under21 caps into a single senior one aside from sustaining technical growth the ages of are recognised as those where tactical improvement must also take place exponentially while physical growth occurs as a natural course of events but what about the mental challenge how do a nations best youngsters manage to cope with the pressure that xabi alonso sergio ramos and iker casillas place on them the successes of these players with more than caps apiece instantly mean that fans the length and breadth of the country expect youngsters to tread the same path to glory laurence griffiths getty images casillas alonso and ramos have full international caps between them they have won the fifa world cup and two uefa european championships the under21s might have tasted success at the euros during the summer but there was surprise and even disappointment in some quarters when the under20s were eliminated at their world cup at the quarterfinal stage speaking directly with midfielder suso prior to that summer tournament he acknowledged the additional pressure was not created by the youngsters themselves but should serve to inspire them nonetheless as i said before spain are the favourites and theyre always going to have that expectation as favourites in spain i think we have more pressure than other nations the senior side is winning everything theyre the best side there is and when that happens then so does this the expectation in all the big clubs and in this case at international level i dont think it should be any hardship or any work instead it should serve as a motivation he also spoke about the importance of getting regular game time something which his parent club liverpool have looked to ensure by loaning him to almeria this season suso is far from the only player to face that challenge this season deulofeu is on loan at everton carles gil at elche and saul niguez at rayo vallecano the pursuit of regular firstteam football is something which can aid the players growth their sense of worth and comfort within unfamiliar team surroundingsalso vital for that first step up at international leveland of course proves that they can showcase their talent on a regular basis next in line and so to the ultimate aim of youth international football to determine exactly who might be next to follow isco and koke and seal their place down the line in the senior setup charlie crowhurst getty images alvaromorata winninggoal hero of both recent under21 games is a candidate a regular squad player for real madrid if he progresses as club and country hope to become a regularstarter for the spanish giants his place in the senior squad is almost assured few spanish players play week in week out for real madrid and do not make the international team david ramos getty images iker muniain has been a class apart for several seasons already despite a dip in form last term and will certainly go on to make his mark at full senior level dani carvajal will follow given time while a whole host of other talents can hope to make the step up suso continues to shine domestically and plays a central role already for the under21s while deulofeu and jese rodriguez have talent aplenty both have much to prove on a regular basis to make it at barcelona and real respectively but the ability is certainly there are these players international class are they world cupwinning class its too early to say but the coaching they receive the facilities on offer to them and the backing of major clubs all over europe will all certainly give them every opportunity after that application desire quality and luck will all play a partand some might say given the timing of these boys in showing themselves almost ready to play for the most talented footballing nation on the planet theyve already been awarded plenty of the latter follow karlmatchettimages courtesy of joaquin martinez pinatar arena quotes from suso courtesy of the liverpool word
2 of course its a little depressing for the canaries to currently find themselves in the relegation zone of the premier league however it is early in the season and there is plenty of time for the club to get things together i have made the point on previous articles that chris hughton is under a certain amount of pressure to continue to ensure that the club progresses season after season it will certainly be interesting to see if that can be achieved which will likely mean a finish in the top half of the table anyone that has watched norwich this season will know that there have been a few positives the team has generally looked good on a number of occasions and the new players seem to be very good additions however the balance in the team has not yet been found that will see a consistent run of results of the new signings ricky van wolfswinkels performance has been somewhat disappointing especially since he was the clubs biggest summer purchase however he set up a goal in the last league match and perhaps things are turning around for the dutch striker in terms of service from the flanks anthony pilkington seems to be playing his way into the team and certainly looks in decent form but his fitness has always been an issue and that is something that will need to be watched nathan redmond has impressed especially in the early part of the season he is certainly a player that has the capabilities to score and assist goals can norwich city finish in the top half this season yesnosubmit votevote to see resultscan norwich city finish in the top half this season yes61 no38 total votes if br polldata br polldata if br polldata br polldata id question can norwich city finish in the top half this season choices choice0 count choice yes choice6 count choice choice1 count choice no choice7 count choice choice2 count choice choice8 count choice choice3 count choice choice9 count choice choice4 count choice choice5 count choice sidebar false if br poll br poll showresults false
4 its taken nearly four years but greg oden is on the precipice of playing nba basketball once again which should have every team in the league outside of south beach shaking in its boots right about now oden participated his first full practice as a member of the miami heat on monday that included playing in some fiveonfive scrimmages during which oden among other things blocked a shot by lebron james the occasion marked the closest oden has come to bona fide nba action since december of when he last suited up for the portland trail blazers oden was encouraged by his latest results though he evidently understands that he still has a long way to go before hes ready to play in an actual game as he told espns michael wallace after practice it felt good to get out there and get some upanddown you can see im frustrated because im not as back as i want to be but its little steps and today was another step getting out there and doing some five on five those steps could include oden taking the court with his heat teammates before the end of the preseason he doesnt seem likely to play in miamis next two exhibitionson the road against the washington wizards and the brooklyn netsthough with proper progress and the absence of swelling in his surgically repaired knee oden could be ready to go shortly thereafter the challenges ahead for the champs issac baldizon getty images on its own odens return isnt reason enough for miamis chief rivals to worry much more than they did before the fragile former no overall pick in the nba draft will be brought along slowly and figures only to play sparingly even when hes regained his bearings the heat for their part should already be of grave concern to the likes of the chicago bulls the indiana pacers and the brooklyn nets in the east not to mention the panoply of title contenders out west theyre coming off three straight eastern conference crowns and backtoback nba championships theyre also bringing back nearly everyone from last years 66win squad save for mike miller who was amnestied this past summer as such this group already knows how to win and is fully capable of winning championships as is the heat will be favored to threepeat come playoff time with or without a healthy oden but the success that miami has enjoyed since lebron james and chris bosh joined dwyane wade in the summer of has been anything but easy to come by the heat had to battle their way to the top and have had to work even harder to stay there last seasons playoffs were proof of as much miami lost game of the second round at home to a shorthanded chicago squad and went the distance with the indiana pacers in the eastern conference finals and the san antonio spurs in the nba finals the latter two cases in particular saw the heat come controversially close to letting a second title slip away nathaniel s butler getty images in all three cases the heat found themselves matched up with teams whose size and strength inside gave the defending champs fits the bulls had their trio of bigs joakim noah carlos boozer and taj gibson while the pacers david west and roy hibbert and the spurs tim duncan and tiago splitter both started pairs of behemoths to be sure miamis issues with bigger opponents came somewhat by design during the summer of heat head coach erik spoelstra and team president pat riley went allin on the brand of positionless small ball the team had employed to survive and advance through the playoffs playing threepoint specialists like shane battier and mike miller up front alongside lebron and bosh allowed miami to spread the floor on offense and play an aggressive trapping style of defense but the system more useful than your usual tactical novelty in the nba wasnt without its flaws with a smaller lineup devoid of bona fide bulk the heat were bound to get beat up on the boards and at the basket especially against opponents that sported more traditional power forwards and centers according to nba com the heat ranked 22nd or lower in all three rebounding percentage categories i e offensive defensive and total moreover having guys like battier and miller to defend bigger stronger forwards left the heat defense susceptible to easy scores forced the rest of the players on the floor to scramble frantically in help situations and ultimately wore down those tasked with sliding up a position its no wonder then that udonis haslem a more traditional power forward ended up starting more often than not last season the heat will need size on their side more than ever now that their toughest foes have all improved over the last few months the bulls have derrick rose back in the lineup and have added a tall sharpshooter of their own mike dunleavy jr to the equation the pacers too will be welcoming in a shooting big chris copeland and an interior bruiser luis scola in addition to the return of danny granger the brooklyn nets are a team of ample size now that kevin garnett paul pierce and andrei kirilenko have joined brook lopez up front as for the new york knicks theyll no longer need to worry so much about their own style of small ball with andrea bargnani serving as the stretch old greg or the oden of old issac baldizon getty images oden alone may not be the silver bullet the heat need to overcome this slew of challengers but what he brings to the table could prove vital to miami surviving yet another gauntlet on the way to a third straight title when healthy oden can step in as yet another twoway big man with the hands to finish on offense and the length strength and sheer mass to be a major factor on defense even if odens only able to play say minutes a night when hes fully fit that might be enough to help the heat mitigate the less desirable effects of their freeflowing style consider chris andersens impact on the heat last year miami was plenty good prior to andersens arrival with a championship already under its belt and a regularseason record in the works but with the birdman aboard the heat soared to new heights his energy athleticism and ability to attack and protect the rim were exactly what miami needed off the bench to not only shore up the teams thin front line but also lend a spark to what wouldve otherwise been a lethargic title defense which eastern conference contender is the biggest threat to the heats supremacy chicago

4 lsu coach johnny jones hired assistant coach david patrick last june before his first season in baton rouge a move that hardly got the attention of anyone who follows college basketball at the time but looking at it now that hire should have been classified as brilliant the reason for such hyperbole is australian big man ben simmons the fourthranked player in the class according to espn com simmons gave lsu a verbal commitment on monday becoming the first player ranked in the top of his class to make his college choice the reason for his decision after making just one college visit seems pretty obvious simmons is the godson of patrick and that connection if it didnt seal the deal got lsu off to a nice head start for a player who was being courted by all the major players including duke kentucky and kansas it was a really laid back conversation because i know all of them so well already simmons wrote in a blog post for usa today of his visit over the weekend david patrick is my godfather and hes an assistant there and so ive always felt really comfortable talking with them simmons though hes a significant recruit is just one recruit and its not likely that patrick has other godsons out there looking to save lsus basketball program but the hiring of patrick goes deeper than winning over just one player simmons is the second aussie to sign with the tigers darcy malone a 7footer will be a freshman for the team this yearand its a pipeline that is likely to continue to be there see patrick grew up in australia and played professionally in australia which is when he met simmons father dave simmons and australia is a recruiting territory worth pursuing the number of australianborn players making an impact in college basketball is growing by the year and the programs that have a connection down under are reaping the benefit saint marys is the innovator in this regard and randy bennett has two australianborn assistants on his staff the gaels had four aussies on their roster last year the two players most deserving of the credit for turning the program into one of the better midmajors in the country are both aussie point guards patty mills and matthew dellavedova rick osentoskiusa today sports former saint marys point guard matthew dellavedova right led his team to two straight ncaa tournament appearances the gaels have made the ncaa tournament four of the last six years when bennett took over the program in the gaels were coming off a season boise state has two starters and an assistant coach from australia and made its first ncaa tournament in five years last season boise state coach leon rice came from gonzaga where mark few has long recruited overseas few has an assistant tommy lloyd who played two seasons professionally in australia new mexico has two australians in its starting lineup the lobos took a trip as a team to australia this summer and coach craig neal has a former saint marys assistant on his staff last year alone a pretty formidable rotation could have been formed with aussies who played in the ncaa tournament you get the point australia has real basketball talent and those programs out west would not be where they are without those coaches using at least one spot on their staff for an assistant with australian ties notable aussieborn players in ncaa tournament aussieborn playerschoolppgmatthew

win at a place like lsu why not gain some kind of recruiting advantage no one else in your conference has just like those schools out west figured out they had to be different to gain an edge jones realized it too hes obviously a good recruiter in the stateshis incoming class was in the top of both rivals coms and espn coms rankingsbut its hard to sustain that kind of success when youre not duke or kentucky or kansas but by stretching his recruiting reach to australia jones created a niche that is sustainable sam forencich getty images dante exum scored points for the winning international team in the nike hoops summit in april it wouldnt be surprising to see at least one aussie in each of lsus recruiting classes along with already getting a commitment from simmons the tigers are in the mix for dante exum who would be one of the best freshmen in the country in all this from hiring one coach who spent a good chunk of his life in australia again its a wonder why more patricks are not popping up on staffs at big schools australian players impacting college basketball cannot be classified as simply a passing trend look at that chart again go watch some tape of exum it could be argued the aussies are developing their talent better than we are in the states jones noticed and now he leads the pack in recruiting the class

4 carmelo anthony and the new york knicks could be the most underestimated team in the nba or they could be one of the more overrated squadrons the league has they could also be exactly who we think they are what exactly is that a topfive team in the eastern conference top four three division champ the brooklyn nets duck soup we dont know and thats the whole problem grantlands zach loweboth put it best and barely scratched the surface when he called the knicks the wackiest bunch of wackadoos in the association new york has somehow managed to loop itself into the same conversation as legitimate title contenders but remains unstable enough to where it could be nothing more than an expensive hot mess with the regular season fast approaching the knicks are no closer to solving their puzzle than we are to figuring out what exactly needs to be fixed the most carmelos befuddlingecstasy elsa getty images the lack of transparency within the knicks organization never ceases to amaze me anthonys shoulder injury was a barely spoken fact heading into the playoffs there was something wrong anyone with two eyes could see it and it was an issue that was kind of theknicksdontreallywantyouintheknow addressed next thing we know melo comes barreling into the preseason talking about how serious the injury it was all types of stuff going on in there anthony said in what the new york posts marc berman writes is his first detailed remarks on his decision this summer it was messed up anthony also went on to explain what a huge risk it was not to go under the knife im ecstatic going from a torn rotator cuff and torn labrum to not needing surgery let me take that back taking a risk in not taking surgery and letting it heal on its down i took a huge risk in doing that it meant i had to put more time in the offseason to do what i had to do to get it right right as rain we dont know with the knicks we never do thats how it is and how its going to stay what we do know is that despite andrea bargnanis presence as the the reigning scoring champ is still going to bully his way to the basket and with that mentality comes bumps bruises and against kevin garnett outright pulls yanks and jerks no worries though because anthony is pumped ive never been percent in my life but its as good as its going to get he said via berman i feel nothing thats such a loaded dose of optimism like a bomb in your lasagna youre sitting down to an authentic italian feast with all the fixings and it looks great then boom your butler and or brother goes rogue anthonys health can still blow up in new yorks collective face surgery may or may not have changed things and he must be commended for ensuring hes ready for the season but in melo the knicks have a bruising scorer who has spent the last decade taking a beating every time he attacks the basket on top of that hes spouting off comments about how hes never been percent another doubleedged sword were impressed in awe worried too its a potluck of emotions outside of the volumeshooters annual dinner im assuming exists thats not good in so many ways anthonys impact is underrated say what you will about his lackluster efficiency and defensive struggles but he takes teams to the playoffs the knicks know this hence theirobsession withgiving him absolute control but you cant put the organization in the hands of an admitted fragile superstar without leaving a stream of questions in your wake the other guys ron hoskins getty images other than anthony the knicks are completely healthysaid no one ever the moretragicthancurious case of amare stoudemire seems to worsen by the day iman shumpert experienced knee soreness during the offseason and j r smiths health issues comprise onepart knee surgery twoparts recreational stupidity theres also bargs who has played in games over the last two seasons and metta world peace whos speedy recovery from knee surgery last year was both incredible and troublesome dont forget about kenyon martin and pablo prigioni the twooldest players on new yorks roster woodson needs to figure out a way to limit tyson chandlers minutes this season for fear of him reaggravating that nasty neck injury but dont worry theres nothing to see here everything is fine the knicks will just aim for the bushes and all will go according to plan making such assumptions is naive in many places new yorks rotation is held together by tape i mean that quite literally health is an issue for every nba team most are just one key injury away from maybe next year chants echoing across their arenas for the knicks its different they too are one injury away from implosion melo across the board however theyre banged up more than most their success depends on the health bills of more players than most bruce bennett getty images new york isnt exactly a poster board for health at the moment stoudemire should be able to help the knicks off the benchif hes healthy bargs gives melo a bona fide no 2if hes healthy shump is a flattoplessstar in the waitingif hes healthy the list like smiths rap sheet goes on and on worse still theres no quick fix questions will plague the knicks all season only when they close out by hoisting the larry obrien trophy into the air or with another early playoff exit will we the knicks included know the extent of the effects health did or didnt have on their season the defense jesse d garrabrant getty images defense loses championships just as much as it wins them the knicks were sort of an anomaly on the defensive end last season they ranked seventh in points allowed per game but 18th in defensive efficiency while its easy to dismiss the points they allowed per possessions and focus solely on the points they relinquished each night the former is important the last team to win a title while ranking outside the top of defensive efficiency was the los angeles lakers that was more than a decade ago below youll see how new yorks defensive rating rank last season compared to that of the last title teams via infogr am are we to believe the champions crowned since then are a series of aberrations of course not belowaverage defenses rarely win championships middling defenses have fallen into the same category making the case of new york especially vexing a healthy shumpert martin and chandler coupled with the additions of bargswho allows melo to defend the 3and world peace can make you believe the knicks will be better off defensively really theres no guarantee theyre better if they are theyre not a lock to be good enough point guards torched the knicks last season for a reason shumpert chandler and world peace cannot defend all five guys for a full minutes defending small forwards will be easier on anthonys body but his effort fluctuates by the status of his opponent not the position hes guarding fielding a top10 defense may also be impossible if the knicks plan on making bargs and stat an integral part of their game plan they do both are poor defenders who are nowhere near physical enough to jostle for position down low with opposing bigs like lowe pointed out the knicks were killed for their habitual doubleteams on defense last season the absence of a legitimate backup center forced them to converge on almost every ballhandler who made his way into the paint asked woodson abt the defenses tendency to double in the post even in preseason he said he was hoping to double less this season chris herring herringwsj october 2013then came the fireworks in the form of open shooters or bigs cutting to the basket for an easy two similar madness could ensue this season or it could get better or worse welcome to the concrete jungle where knowledge isnt so much power as it isserendipitously nonexistent what are they playing for rocky widner getty images championships stupid they bellowed in unison i know that but while i hate to be the guy who puts sand in the potato salad are they really anthony is essentially on an expiring contract hes expected to opt out of the last year of his current deal next summer and become an unrestricted free agent at which point teams across the league lakers lakers lakers will pull out all the stops the knicks have an inherent edge over any and all competition under the current cba they can offer him five years and roughly million other teams can only offer him a maximum of four years pushing that extra year and the tens of millions of dollars that come with it are going to catch anthonys attention my gut says hell resign then again i dont really know these are the knicks investing nine figures in a soontobe 30yearold who has openly admitted hes never been percent isnt ideal either way the most diehard knicks fans must understand this banking on the second superstar to join him in when new york can start almost fresh isnt idiotproof either usa today sports lets not pretend free agency two summers from now will be the same as it might not be its time to stop pretending that the freeagency class isnt becoming vastly overrated as well kyrie irving isnt going to hit the open market rarely do players coming off rookie deals get that far especially when theyre as talented as irving or jimmy butler or kawhi leonard rajon rondo should be available but the knicks have poured enough money into offensively inclined players with a history of knee problems to last them a lifetime allan houston stat etc chasing marc gasol sounds fun but hell be too throwing four years and boatloads of money at any big on the wrong side of is a red flag by itself no matter who they are unless lebron is planning on opting in for one more year with the miami heat possible the summer of will be a pretty underwhelming experience one that

4 all nba coaches should experience such agitation while other coachesare still scouring their rosters trying to find eight or nine legitimate players to fill out a passable rotation miami heat coach erik spoelstra is facing daily questions about how he will find minutes for proven veterans nine of whom were prominently featured during last seasons 27game winning streak and the championship run and now as the heat get more good newsgreg odens incremental additions to his workloadspoelstra is frequently getting asked about how hell find a fit for a 15th spoelstra quickly tires of such queries especially when he isnt particularly eager to offer complete answers and it hasnt taken long for him to grow weary of the oden watch derick e hingleusa today sport as spoelstra said following sundays practice theres no update he was able to do some work today but no new update no there wont be a new update i know theres a lot of interest hell continue to make steps forward monday there was another with oden participating in a fiveonfive fullcourt scrimmage that was closed to the media players including lebron james and dwyane wade told reporters that they were encouraged by odens work during the session and spoelstra again pumped the brakes expect spoelstra to continue taking that approach even if oden does find his way into one of the final three preseason gamessaturday at home against the san antonio spurs next wednesday in new orleans against the pelicans or next friday in miami against the brooklyn nets the teams strategy is to try to quiet the noise from the outside so it doesnt seep into odens psyche he chose miami largely because he knew the heat were positioned to let him proceed at his own pace to come back after major knee surgeries since last playing in an nba game in if he tries to rush back to full health hell run more risks and his teammates can help by winning early in the season if they do that there will be less focus on when oden will return since its not known how spoelstra can clear minutes for him but if the heat are getting bludgeoned on the boards or again start slowly on defense there will be more calls to rip off the bubble wrap if oden becomes a necessity rather than a luxury his progress becomes a bigger storyline and spoelstra gets a bigger headache ethan skolnick covers the miami heat for bleacher report
4 beijing the hero being worshipped understands the why and the how of it kobe bryant gets that the drive and perseverance he has demonstrated as a basketball player resonate with a chinese culture thats all about dutiful work ethic and individual responsibility but more than anything bryant feels the where of it this is china where the world is not free where the simple escape outlet to see a movie is limited to what the communist government allows where uniting the world through twitter or facebook and the freedom to search google is denied where you are allowed to have only one child when bryant in basketballcan be asliberated ashe is while working as hard as he does the impact in china becomes something he likens to the wonderful free ride that music takes us on in america i think it strikes a chord with the fans out here bryant said monday in a quieter moment after nearly being trampled by chinese reporters rushing to his first media access of the nba global games its something that inspires them oo ready function oo player create ooyala container swoxb0zjrebgr22c chvz83qdiqzeelw swoxb0zjrebgr22c chvz83qdiqzeelw enablechannels true googleimaadsmanager showinadcontrolbar true height oncreate function player br video addooyalaeventlistener player swoxb0zjrebgr22c chvz83qdiqzeelw width in china they have their reasons to be holding out for a hero till the end of the night fans in the u s have kind of gone through this progression of hero marketing bryant said they kind of lived through that in the 80s with michael and magic and kind of having the fanaticism now i think it has evolved with so many media outlets it has evolved to something beyond that where were a little bit more desensitized by celebrities out here not so much under the oppression of communist rule they still arent footloose so bryant to them is much like jordan was to us its harder for me to walk around here than it is in the states bryant said the states you get a lot of recognitionhi and they want your autograph and so forth and so onbut out here its uncontrollable they really rush you and surround you and it becomes something where you cant go out nevertheless bryant has made himself available coming to china on nike promotional tours for eight consecutive years its a big percentage of my nike business he explained yet even that enterprise is done with a nod to how and why he is on a pedestal here andrew d bernstein getty images bryant remembers what drew him to a yao mingboosted china in the first place the honest love for learning the games fundamentals that he felt in the basketball clinics he conducted in the passion they have for the game was fun to be around he recalled it was like you were teaching the game to people who really want to learn who have a thirst to learn so because of it i just started coming back bryant said he hasnt expanded his product line to meet the massive demand in china because he doesnt want it to seem gimmicky or like hes straying from innovation he wants his connection with this market to remain rooted in something real its very important for me to challenge them to inspire them as much as possible he said i refuse to do it just for the sake of generating revenue there was a sense about bryant on monday that he knows theres much to live up to here after weeks of limited updates on his rehabilitation from april surgery for his torn achilles tendon bryant was forthcoming about his excitement over the progress if today was a playoff or nba finals game could i play probably bryant said if that game were in china there would be riots if he didnt play andrew d bernstein getty images despite playing his entire career in los angeles its safe to say that there is no more of a home game for bryant anywhere than in china so the hero not being healthy enough to play in exhibition games this week in beijing and shanghai is no small loss to worshippers such as the one bryants trainer tim grover recalls seeing on one of his recent china tours he must have climbed a fence that was feet up in the air grover said he was sitting there trying to get a picture of kobe and kobe when he was leaving took off his shoes and threw his shoe into the crowd this guy he just took a leap of faith from feet up just diving and trying to get the shoe didnt think twice about it grover who has worked closely and traveled with both michael jordan and bryant remembers jordan being titled the basketball god in china for the inspiration he provided during his career and even now grover has also been on site with bryant in recent years when the chinese government citing too many fans has shut down bryants promotional events to grover its important to understand just how drawn chinese fans are to the individuals power to rise above theyre not lakers fans or heat fans or anything they are fans of the super superstars of the nba he said and of all the current players in the nba and ive traveled with quite a few of them kobe is by far the no kevin ding covers the lakers and the nba for bleacher report
4 deron williams ankle sprain hasnt cost the brooklyn nets just yet but if the franchise point guard cant get healthy his teams championship chase might be over before it starts according to mike mazzeo of espn nets head coach jason kidd said of williams health this is going to be a question that were probably going to have to deal with every day until he does get the green light to go but were not rushing him so if we have to start the season with him still trying to get better i think we all feel comfortable but we would feel a little bit more comfortable if he was starting williams sprained his right ankle while working out in utah over the summer during camp hes been limited to light work and has spent a bit more time on the stationary bike than the nets would prefer and while its too early to start sounding the alarm bells williams injury and slow recovery is worrying because weve already seen the timetable for his return pushed back once before in addition this isnt the average ankle were dealing with williams injury issuesspecifically with his anklesdate back to when he had to be carried off the floor after spraining his left ankle in a preseason game against the chicago bulls joe murphy getty images granted tweaked ankles are part of life in the nba everyone deals with them but not every player in the league has to undergo a third set of cortisone injections and plateletrichplasma therapy during the allstar break in order to rediscover his prime form williams looked rejuvenated during the final three months of the season but only after he had extensive work done on both ankles now were back to where we started with williams sidelined because of ankle troubles so this is a bummer for williams on an individual basis but its far more problematic for the nets wholl be lost without him say what you want about dwills penchant for coach killing and his tendency to dominate the ball but he gives brooklyn an offensive dimension it cant get anywhere else if williams isnt fully healthy the nets difficult road through the eastern conference could become almost impossible constant threatyou cant get much done against the best nba defenses these days without applying pressure in a way that forces realignment help rotations and ideally a little chaos good teams are too disciplined and too savvy to be bothered by ball movement alone though so to crack top defenses penetration is a must williams is the nets only accomplished offthedribble attacker which is why hes so critical to the teams offensive success not only that but hes also easily brooklyns most dangerous pickandroll operator so in that sense hes almost solely responsible for controlling the two ways in which the nets apply pressure to some of the easts stingiest defensive outfits defenses have to account for his ability to beat most opponents in oneonone situations that means help defenders have to either shade toward him early or dive in late to recover after he works his way into the lane either way williams ability to penetrate creates opportunities for other players on the floor because defenders have to focus first on keeping him from scoring at the rim the same is true of his work on the pickandroll because dwill is so difficult to stop once he turns the corner defenders have to work extremely hard and coaches have to install disciplined schemesto keep him from getting free access to the middle of the floor there are lots of ways to do this downing the play which means sending williams to the sideline at all costs is a common onebut no matter what williams ability to attack necessarily means theres less attention paid to the rest of the nets offensive players if williams is healthy brook lopez gets more room to roll and whoever the nets opt to station in the corner as a threepoint threat gets better looks brooklyn has a considerable amount of offensive firepower but most of its weapons need to be properly set up before they can pull the trigger williams is responsible for creating shots for others and if hes not fully healthy the nets will have a harder time getting maximum value out of their secondary scoring options remember there havent been any reports yet that say williams will miss a significant chunk of the season but if he manages to make an openingnight return theres still no guarantee that hell be ready to perform like he did down the stretch last year and thats a serious problem because we know how punchless the nets looked when williams was playing in pain in before those magical injections in february dwill was a wreck he couldnt hit a perimeter shot and had lost almost all of his explosiveness amazingly hecouldnt dunk the ball either after aggressive treatment he was a star check out his pre and postallstar splits below deron williams remarkable recovery mpgppgapgrpgfg 3p before allstar break36 516 77 63 3 413 347after allstar break36 422 98 02 5 481 420nba comthe nets cant afford another halfseason of mediocrity this year other optionsif williams is hobbled or altogether unavailable to start the season brooklyns first attempt to replace his production will likely focus on options within the organization lopez proved to be a dominant player in the post last year and its possible that the nets would try to replicate some of the pressure williams created by getting the ball onto the block more often per synergy subscription required nearly percent of lopezs touches came in the post last season and in those situations he ranked very near the leagues top percent in points per possession joe camporealeusa today sports a larger dose of lopez on the block is a dangerous thing though the big man posted the thirdlowest assist rate among qualifying centers last year per espn which means the rest of brooklyns perimeter options would basically be stuck standing around without a purpose once the ball went into the post lopez doesnt turn the ball over much but he has also never shown an ability to get anyone else involved brooklyns offense would essentially grind to a halt if he played a larger role so if lopez cant be an offensive hub in place of williams perhaps kevin garnett and paul pierce could handle expanded duties after all they ran things for the boston celtics last year after rajon rondo went down remember though that the celtics finished last year ranked 20th in offensive efficiency because they relied on a steady diet of jump shots and almost never managed to get to the rim garnett and pierce are both highly intelligent unselfish offensive players but they cant give brooklyn what williams can plus theyre each a year older and are unlikely to be up to the challenge of taking on additional responsibilities joe camporealeusa today sports they came to brooklyn to join dwill not to replace him the nets last resortat least in terms of internal stopgaps for williamswould be to give more ballhandling duties to jason terry or shaun livingston its probably not necessary to belabor the point that neither player is cut out to handle an expanded role so well keep this chunk of analysis brief for more than a decade terry has been a spark plug scorer who ends possessions with jumpers hes not the kind of guard who can get into the lane let alone finish or set up teammates and livingston is little more than an endofthebench reserve hes not the answer either perhaps that leaves a trade as the only real possibility to replace a potentially slowed williams orlando magic point guard jameer nelson is highly expendable and is only guaranteed million in the finances would be tricky as brooklyn lacks the kinds of expiring contracts and draft picks the magic would want but if desperation sets in the nets might be forced to get creative no margin for errorwith a roster this talented it might not seem like a huge problem if williams has to sit out a few weeks or takes some time to round into form the nets are deep experienced and hungry to win so they could probably find a way to survive for a short time but brooklyn isnt trying to merely survive this year its trying to chase a title and with the east looking more dangerous than ever the nets may not be able to recover if they lose ground by playing at less than full strength michael hickey getty images the miami heat are still the favorites the indiana pacers are vastly improved and the chicago bulls are back on everyones championship short list that puts the nets at best in the no spot in the eastern conference but if they stumble the new york knicks atlanta hawks or even the detroit pistons could hop right over them snatching away homecourt advantage in the first round of the playoffs its going to be a brutal fight in the east this year and every regularseason game is going to count brooklyn cant afford to play at less than full strength for any extended length of time its early but brad pennerusa today sports until we get word that williams is officially going to be wearing a suit instead of a jersey on opening night its too early to panic if fully healthy the nets are right on the cusp of belonging in the championship conversation even at percent they might not be quite as good as the top three teams in the eastern conference but theyre darn close at the same time we know for sure that theyre nowhere near elite unless all of their weapons are in working order williams is the most important player on brooklyns roster if hes not able to give the nets a full season of his best work the nets are doomed to disappoint

2 two players involved in two of europes biggest ongoing transfer sagas come headtohead on tuesday evening with england facing poland knowing that three points are required to secure their place at next summers world cup manchester uniteds wayne rooney who despite publicly stating his focus on remaining at old trafford according to the metro continues to be linked with moves elsewhere will front up againstprolific borussia dortmund striker robert lewandowski a player whose own future will remain up in the air until either a new contract has been signed at the westfalenstadion or a transfer has been completed to take him to pastures anewwith the telegraph reporting that a deal to bayern munich is by no means assured and that the premier league may still be an option adam nurkiewicz getty images englands place at the world cup is likely to rest on the shoulders of their leading active goalscorer while lewandowski returns to the stadium where he was unable to lead his club side to european glory back in may and will undoubtedly be keen to make an impression on potential new paymasters but before the pair clash at wembley heres a look at the pairs relevant strengths and styles while posing the question of who is better wayne rooney or robert lewandowski alex livesey getty images wayne rooneysince bursting onto the scene as a precocious 16yearold at everton wayne rooney has been one of the premier leagues best forwards for the better part of a decade now rooney has grown from a boy in blue to a man in red and white whose ability and goalscoring acumen have seen him compile international goals in appearances his almostdecade at old trafford has included premier league goals in matches wayne rooney fourth player after bobby charlton denis law and jack rowley to reach doublecentury for mufc daniel taylor dtguardian september 2013trophies have followed including five premier league crowns and one champions leagueas well as two other final appearancesas well as numerous individual honours and although there have been controversies during his time with united including the recent furore over supposed problems with exunited boss sir alex ferguson as reported by the telegraph rooneys onpitch ability has never been in doubt certainly he has experienced a number of peaks and some pretty damning lowshis performances during the world cup in south africa came in for particular scrutinybut he has long been considered a genuine worldclass talent both by supporters and among his peers reasons for that are numerous rooney is a player of great technical quality a powerful finisher and an excellent passer across varying distances additionally he is physically strong possesses great desire and a will to win while also being an incredibly intelligent interpreter of space in all he is extremely well rounded and that wellroundedness alongside a tremendous versatility which very few footballers can match continue to make rooney as jonathan wilson wisely put it a unique talent is he as good a finisher as robin van persie no is he as skillful as lionel messi no is he as astute a passer as xavi no is he as good in the air as andy carroll no does he see the game as well as andres iniesta no does he regain possession as well as lucas leiva no but he is a fascinating hybrid of all six there are very few players as flexible as rooney during uniteds successful champions league run of he often played second fiddle to cristiano ronaldo withdrawing to wide roles to cover the portuguese players defensive deficiencies when ronaldo departed for real madrid he became almost a prototype no staying high and central from where he scored a number of goals via antonio valencia crosses as well as one particularly majestic performance against ac milan in the champions leaguein and when playing almost exclusively as the furthest forward united striker he netted goals across all competitions in each campaign the season in between he acted as a teddy sheringhamesque no to the newly arrived javier hernandez and premier league top scorer dimitar berbatov and since the arrival of robin van persie it is back to that support striker role where he has returned and which he has long filled for england arguably it is perhaps his best position due to his versatility and talent he has often been moved to different positions or been given varying tactical instructions so as to accommodate others argentinas carlos tevez is a similar case but it is something that helps make rooney such an intriguing commodity while his ability marks him out as such a fantastic if occasionally misguided talent david ramos getty images robert lewandowskisince impeaching paraguayan lucas barrios as the preferred no in jurgen klopps formation with die borussen at the beginning of the season lewandowski has proven himself nothing short of a worldclass striker that season saw lewandowski score times in bundesliga matches a total he increased last season netting goals in league appearances a further six goals have followed in seven league matches this term also however it was in last seasons champions league semifinal first leg against real madrid that the 25yearold proved once and for all that his name stands among the elite strikers in world football with a devastating fourgoal showing in a success for his club a perfect display in both finishing and the art of the lone striker lewandowskis strength technique intelligence and ability to link with onrunning teammates were on full display as he terrorised the blancos back line yet perhaps the beauty of lewandowskis interpretation of his role as a central striker is the rather linear approach he takes to it in short its simplicity is strikinglegendary liverpool manager bill shankly coloured it best when he said football is a simple game complicated by idiots and the former lech poznan man doesnt overcomplicate things when its unnecessary with the aim simply to head toward the opponents goal as soon as possible every touch every move is done with a purpose whether to enable himself to add to his rather impressive goalscoring tally since becoming a firstteam regular under klopp75 goals in matches since the start of 201112or to tee up one of his colleagues simple passes are routine to move the ball to a player in a better position while the instinct whenever he finds the allimportant halfayard in and around the penalty area is to pull the trigger he is very much a classic no for the modern day robert lewandowski the text book number tonight tall athletic lean quick touch awareness movement goals a gem in a awesome side aaron danks coachdanks april 2013however all of that is not to say that he isnt capable of moments of utter genius as any watcher of the aforementioned champions league match can quantify the touch roll and finish to evade a despairing pepe and fire past diego lopez wouldnt have looked out of place in a dennis bergkamp highlight reel but the pole has the intelligence to recognise similar to the likes of andriy shevchenko that the vast majority of time the simplest course of action is the best particularly for a striker whose predatory instincts are best served in the 18yard box perhaps when talking of lewandowski as an allround player the only slight on him is that like radamel falcao or mario gomez positionally he is very much only a centreforward you wont see him lining up in a wide position nor playing in a support role to another striker a la rooneyhe is very much the main man nonetheless that positional versatility is very much a case of splitting hairs for in all other aspects of his game as far as pure no 9s go the twotime bundesliga winner is very much a part of the worlds elite verdictthe verdict on who is better out of the two is purely subjective everyone will have their own personal preference adam nurkiewicz getty images what differentiates the pair is their stylesboth have their strengths both have their different weaknessesand for that reason making a pure comparison of who is better is a rather erroneous task instead it is better to differentiate the pair and to then pass judgement on who is more suited to what needs if a side requires an outstanding pure no who will lead the line and bring others into play while fulfilling the objective of scoring plenty of goals on a regular basis then robert lewandowski is your man putting aside hyperbole the polish hitman is one of the very best centreforwards around today ian walton getty images on the other hand if a more versatile morerounded attacking threat is required then wayne rooney has been and still is one of world footballs biggest talents capable of occupying numerous roles with tremendous vision and technique hes a very different beast to lewandowski but no less effective of the two lewandowski is a more clinical finisher sharper in the penalty area while his holdup play with his back to goal is arguably as good as anyone on the planet but in other areas of his game such as passing range and the ability to drop into holes and dictate play from deep he cant match rooney thus its best to just focus on the excellence of both each has proven themselves an outstanding performer at the pinnacle of the european game and both have the necessary qualities to grace the very best of world footballs elite

2 unfitforduty managers spoilt players biased referees and a hand of god have all been to blame for the perceived underperformance of the england national football team now were told foreign imports can be added to that list players from spain argentina france belgium et al are the currently fashionable phenomenon on which to heap blame thats right sergio aguero and romelu lukaku its all your fault that england still need a home win against poland to guarantee a place in the world cup a recent survey by opta commissioned by the bbc and sensationally dubbed state of the game found that english players accounted for percent of all minutes played in the premier league season by comparison germanys bundesliga saw percent of game time fulfilled by those eligible to play for the nationalmannschaft and in spains la liga the figure was percent of course this has prompted the usual spasm of excited and illconstructed reactionsthe majority of which mainly exist to demonstrate that joey bartons tweets are far from the only vacuous thoughts on the beautiful game the fashionable proposal of the past week or so involves placing a quota on the number of english players that must play for premier league clubs an idea that is predictably faesque in its isolationist and degenerative values its typical of the pedestal on which english football places itself that so many of the whos who of the game on these shores seem to think that the answer to greater national team success rests with limiting foreign involvement on the pitch news flash foreigners are better than us at football banning them from competing with our own players every week either for a place in their teams starting or as a member of the opposition is the last thing we should be doing removing world class players from our elite competition would have an immediate detrimental effect on not only the current england squad but also on the football education and diversity of potential future stars to be the best we must compete with the best in the years leading up to the world cup in the usa the premier league was loaded with english players how well did we do at the tournament laurence griffiths getty images would capping the number of foreign premier league players really help england sheer player numbers is not the answer contrary to what the excitable pundits might have you believe there are an enormous number of english players playing in our professional leagues english players racked up percent of minutes played in the team championship last season demonstrating that home grown players are out there and playing football the issue clearly is not a lack of eligible england players but that not enough of these players are good enough to ply their trade in the premier league belgium spain argentina portugal and uruguay among others are countries with smaller populations than the roughly million that reside in england and yet seemingly without too much difficulty recent years have seen more success and more young talent spawn from these countries than our own the problem then is with the coaching a few startling numbers according to the telegraph the number of english coaches holding uefas alevel license is a little over in germany that number is around and in spain its at the very top level the uefa pro license england has some coaches germany over and spain exceeds implementing a quota on the number of coaches the fa can entice to graduate with such honours would surely be a better and more positive approach to a better national team than the desperation that is so clear to see with player quotas getting just half as many coaches with top qualifications as germany would be a start paid youth coaches with access to quality facilities either standalone or in schools are needed in far higher numbers than they are currently available a concerted effort must be made to train and excite kids to not simply play football but to want to excel in it youth football should be less about trying to replicate the competitive league structure of the professional game and more about instilling the fundamentals of what makes a great player creating a fun and diverse training environment in which kids can develop a desire to go on and master the depths of the sport will produce players with the kind of drive and determination we see in so much of the talent coming out of germany and spain teaching their teams not winning with them should be the youth coachs only measured goal how the fa can entice more coaches to qualify at the highest level is more complicated but some combination of cheaper courses adaptive training hours to suit working lives and better access to top class facilities would be a start jan kruger getty images better coaches and facilities are badly needed to foster youth development englands lack of world class talent though is not just the result of a failure at youth level senior level players are also too regularly falling short of reaching their potential interestingly chelseas belgianborn midfielder kevin de bruyne has highlighted a potential reason for the shortcoming inferior exploitation of the loan system by english players the 22yearold on loan at werder bremen last season makes a sound point english players do not for whatever reason go abroad on loan with little to no chance of making the chelsea first team de bruyne instead spent last season playing games at the top of level of german football against the likes ofbayern munich borussia dortmund and bayer leverkusen contrast that against the likes of wilfried zaha who spent last season on loan at crystal palace and played against thewolves peterborough united and bristol city and you begin to understand the development benefits of playing abroad for a year or two sure the bundesliga may not have the depth of class that currently resides in the premier league but its a whole lot more challenging and beneficial than playing in the second tier of english football in fact its precisely that comparative lack of depth that allows players like de bruyne the chance to play regular first team football at a high level and experience the differences within domestic and european cup competition an even more telling example is occurring this very season jack butland hyped as the next big thing in english goalkeeping is currently contracted to the premier leagues stoke city but finds himself on loan at championship side barnsley this season butland is in his fourth season as a professional and has made a total of appearances for various english clubs of them while on loan and none at topflight level gonzalo arroyo moreno getty images players such as chelseas thibaut courtois have excelled on loan abroad its time english players did the same by comparison thibaut courtois of chelsea has spent the past three seasons on loan playing in atletico madrids firstteam atletico are flying high having won all of their eight leagues this season and performing equally well in their champions league group courtois is a mere months older than butland but has already amassed games for atletico and for belgiums racing genk barring injury he will have notched up over competitive games for atletico before the end of this season not only that but courtois plays against the likes of barcelona real madrid and in this seasons champions league f c porto on a weekly basis which goalkeeper will benefit more from their respective loan deal the belgian playing top level european football or the englishman doing that ever so british thing and refusing to leave the comfort of the island and that doesnt even begin to touch on the advantages that living abroad and outside of your selfimposed comfort zone can have on your personal development as a person and a player the butland courtois example is hardly the exception to the rule british premier league clubs send their young foreign players out on loan to top european leagues every season whereas english players loaned out by the same club find themselves in the championship or league its just another example of englands insistence on isolating its football talent and preventing it from learning and experiencing from abroad a basic rethink of values and core practises is what is required to rejuvenate a deteriorating national team setup not a simple headline grabbing quota system unfortunately such an overhaul cannot be achieved overnight or in a single season a genuine patient longterm plan is the only way a change of this kind can be implemented with any lasting effect an added benefit with this kind of long term plan however is that while were building for the future from the groundup were not disrupting the quality of the current england team by reducing the quality of players our future hopes are training and playing against plus do we really want to downgrade the premier league
2 if you are not a manchester united supporter you might not want to admit it but one cant but help feel a pang of sympathy fordavid moyes at the moment the old trafford manager was never going to face an easy task following the retirement of sir alex ferguson after years at the helm of the club now he will have to contend with a new road at old trafford named in his successors honour as john scheerhout of the manchester evening news reported while ferguson has also been given the freedom of trafford moyes is already sittingin a dugout which faces the sir alex ferguson stand while a statue of the 71yearold resides at thefront of thesame area of the ground via bbc sport the latest tribute to ferguson is thoroughly deserved but the timing of its unveiling can hardly be described as ideal for moyes when moyes was announced as the man to succeed ferguson before the end of the last premier league season there were plenty of dissenting voices mixing with the calls of support most notably from the outgoing boss himself clive brunskill getty images when moyes officially took over on july the spotlight became something else altogether the issue of wayne rooneys future was the hot topic at the time of moyes ascension to the united hotseat but there then followed a disappointing transfer window in which a public chase of barcelona midfielder cesc fabregas and athletic club bilbaos ander herrera all fell flat the fallout from the lack of transfer activity is still ongoing with benfica defender ezequiel garay outlining the collapse of his move to the premier league champions in the summer as gordon tynan of the independent among others reported on monday morning ultimately moyes ended up with just marouane fellaini added to his squad from former club everton and the intensity of the media glare was shared between moyes and united chief executive ed woodward over the lack of new arrivals and of course uniteds form on the field was always going to be monitored closely a openingday victory at swansea city augured well for the new regime but subsequent defeats to liverpool manchester city and then worst of all the home loss to west bromwich albion left united trailing the title contenders in 12th place in the league adnan januzaj inspired a comeback victory at sunderland before the international break which lifted some of the gloom around united supporters and afforded moyes some breathing space however it is the spectre of ferguson which is almost certainly the biggest burden moyes has to deal with in his new role after years at goodison park the ghosts of success at the scots first managerial appointment in preston had long since left the deepdale building even though the legendary sir tom finney sat in the stands regularly as moyes guided the club to the old second division title in before taking the club to within minutes of the premier league when they were beaten by bolton in the division one playoff final the following year the golden ages of and the mid1980s at goodisonwere well and truly overwhen moyes made the move to merseyside in march of everton supporters had endured two lastday escapes from relegation between their last title win in and the former celtic defenders arrival they were simply happy for the comfort of midtable for a season or two clive brunskill getty images moyes excelled at both but now all roads lead to the inevitable comparisons with ferguson sir alex is a living legend at old trafford nobody could deny that after he shook the club out of its slumber and occasional fa cup win to build a dynasty which won trophies across domestic and european competition but while ferguson fully deserves the title of living legend and the plaudits which have followed thenaming of a road in his honour merely underlines the shadow he casts at old trafford such public relations are a testament to the job done by the former boss since his appointment in but the timing will not help moyes as he attempts to steer united on to a another highway to success

2 robert lewandowski is in england and if he has his way he just might be back to stay in a few months time speaking to the telegraph ahead of tuesdays world cup qualifier against england at wembley the poland international revealed he was still available to the highest bidder insisting he had never said a contract with bayern munich had already been agreed upon a selection of lewandowski goals for borussia dortmund it was a misunderstanding he said adding i will be able to sign a contract with any club in january lewandowskis latest remarks fly in the face of comments he made to german television channel sport1 just last month when he indicated a precontract with bayern would be finalized in januaryfive months before his current pact with borussia dortmund is set to expire guardian and after angling for an exit out of dortmund during the summer the 25yearold told polish newspapers that it was not fair for the bundesliga club to keep hold of him against his wishes i dont know if the situation will fail to leave a mark on me he mused its in my subconscious and there will come a time when i will be in a bad mood before the game no doubt each of manchester united chelsea manchester city arsenal and liverpool are hoping the strikers mood improves should they manage to pry him from dortmunds clutches during the january transfer window the premier league giants could also open talks with lewandowski regarding a precontract should dortmund opt to keep him at signalidunapark until the end of the season lewandowski didnt deny having a deal with bayern he denied admitting to having a deal with bayern readinghelps raphael honigstein honigstein october 2013united who could use some added oomph in the attack have been linked to the twotime bundesliga champion in the past telegraph and in an august interview with the sun lewandowski admitted to having had previous contact with former united boss sir alex ferguson regarding a switch to old trafford goal there was definitely a great feeling he said at the time chelsea too have had contact with lewandowski lewandowski scores four goals against jose mourinhos real madrid last season jose mourinho who quit real madrid for chelsea in the spring sent the pole a text message following his fourgoal showing against the spanish side in last seasons champions league and his interest in the player is thought to have followed him to stamford bridge it was a private conversation so i dont want to make big things out of it lewandowski told the sun i can confirm i spoke to him goal manchester city are also thought to have made a play for lewandowski during the summer express although the acquisitions of alvaro negredo and stevan jovetic took them down a different path and arsenal attacker lukas podolski speaking to polish outlet polska the times did his best to drum up a swoop for lewandowski from his own side saying he can make it anywhere and he would fit perfectly at arsenal goal liverpool meanwhile have yet to be linked to the former lech poznan frontman although that could change in the offchance they decide to move luis suarez out of the club either in january or next summer lewandowski prefers bundesliga stay so he can fulfil his dream of playing in the premier league for the worlds greatest team real madrid samuel marsden samuelmarsden october 2013a saturday report in the mirror divulged that the reds were prepared to lose the uruguay international to either arsenal or real madrid and given the hole suarezs exit would leave in the liverpool attackas well as the cash windfall theyd come into with a salean approach for lewandowski would make sense but would swapping one controversial striker for another be in their interests and for the other premier league sides mulling an offer for lewandowski would acquiring a player who never seems to be happy and who changes his story at a whim be in theirs thats the question theyll have weigh against lewandowskis goalscoring ability that is if his most recent claims about bayern are actually true
2 frances win over australia at the parc des princes on friday was perfect preparation for a final fifa world cup qualifier against finland on tuesday didier deschamps side after scoring just four goals in seven games all year has now scored in their last two this sudden glut of goals gives the 44yearold some selection dilemmas not least going forward as les bleus seek to secure themselves the best possible position going into the world cup qualifying playoffs admittedly france do find themselves at a disadvantage around the playoff seedings given that they were drawn in group i which only boasts five teams the french football federation have indicated via president noel le graet to rmc radio espn fc that they will contest the decision over seedings however deschamps side has failed to score in two of their seven qualification matches against spain and georgia since he took over from laurent blanc they have also played in seven other friendly matches during that time including five where they have failed to score a single goal if it did not look so bleak in qualification terms friendlies against the likes of brazil uruguay and japan have exposed the weaknesses of the current generation add that to playing two fewer qualification games in group i than the rest of their likely playoff opponents and you can understand why france will almost certainly go into the draw unseeded scoring six goals against a weak australia side may be morale boosting but those goals need to be translated on to the competitive stage for it to indicate any real progress ahead of the clash with finland deschamps has a number of considerations david rogers getty images firstly karim benzema as well as olivier giroud found the net against the socceroos although that is a big boost for the team it is also what deschamps has been desperate to see happen since benzema embarked on a hideous run of minutes without a single international strike the french tactician came in for some fierce criticism at times for putting his faith in the real madrid man instead of giroud fridays goal at the parc des princes may well feel like vindication in a way for deschamps there is a chance that despite his two goals the arsenal man might have to make way for benzema given that his coach has demonstrated that he considers the 25yearold part of his strongest xi although it was a major boost to see benzema find the net les bleus firsthalf showing without him on the field suggested that they would be just as dangerous sticking with giroud david rogers getty images benzema was not the only player to have answered his critics against australia samir nasris return to grace was completed by his first starting appearance for france since the illfated european championship in poland and ukraine as reported by espn fc the manchester city man made his international comeback earlier this year in the friendly against belgium as reported by espn fc but he put in a strong performance when given the chance on friday and could now usurp mathieu valbuena for the finland clash however valbuena has been a stalwart for deschamps since the former olympique de marseille coach took over from blanc dropping him would mean losing one of his key components on this france team 15 mathieu valbuena is the only player to have played in each of the france games under didier deschamps era prestige optajean optajean october 2013while loyalty is no doubt a factor in the potential decision nasris excellent domestic form with manchester city at present may well swing the vote his way the nasrivalbuena conundrum wont like be the only midfield headache that deschamps is contending with blaise matuidi was rested for the majority of the australia clash and will almost certainly walk straight back into the starting xi irrepressible for club and country the paris saintgermain star is one ofthe few players in the current france setup who can be legitimately considered indispensable david rogers getty images that means short of an overhaul in terms of playing style there will be a fight between paul pogba and yohan cabaye for the midfield berth alongside matuidi the newcastle united man is the more familiar and has greater international experience and he also scored against australia last week but pogbas rise to prominence has been so meteoric that by the time the world cup arrives he will be indispensable his early performances for les bleus have more than demonstrated that he is already capable at senior international level and maturing all the time after his red card against spain earlier this year matuidipogba is almost certainly the central midfield partnership of the future for france so why not continue the juventus mans development by cementing his partnership with matuidi the final debate in deschamps mind ahead of the game will be whether to go with youth or experience in the centre of defence david rogers getty images both raphael varane and eric abidal featured against australia and mamadou sakho was also given valuable game time in the second half arsenals laurent koscielny appears to be the most indispensable of deschamps defenders though so it is assumed that he will return against finland given varanes lack of match practice it looks more likely to be the real madrid youngster who makes way for koscielny abidal is no spring chicken though despite the importance of his positive influence within the current group there can be no doubt who is the better partner abilitywise for the arsenal man now and in the future if fit enough to start varanes development will be aided by further competitive international minutes the player recently told ligue1 com how flattered he was to be compared to brazilian international thiago silva however given the importance of this match experience may well prove the safest and most appealing option for deschamps the result will likely have little bearing on frances hopes of avoiding the playoffs though les bleus still need to hope that spain are beaten at home by georgia who have only won once all campaign instead france needs deschampswell and truly to make his mind up about his strongest starting xi and to play them against finland a good result will breed continuity ahead of next months playoffs

together whenever a famous person or group of famous people lands well you aint seen nothing yet im still waiting on this type of fanfare whenever a plane im on lands just fyi but dont expect the crowds to be the only craziness during this excursion for example did you ever think youd see jordan farmar on a camel this is what happens on the walk to the great wall jrfarmar on a camel lakers pic twitter com izclfqsn5z kevin ding kevinding october 2013theres no telling the effect it might have on his basketball game especially as he makes his return to the nba after playing in turkish league last season but the point guard certainly looks at home even that may not have been the most unlikely image how about pau gasol walking away from a haggling session because his asking price wasnt met the spanish 7footer has always been one of the nice guys in the association so kevin ding and just about everyone else was quite surprised when he didnt just cave in and spend some of his fortune of course dont think theyre just seeing the sights and doing the rounds practice is happening too see we even have visual evidence biggest news itemsupdate tuesday oct at am et by adam fromalthe lakers played their first exhibition game in shanghai losing to the golden state warriors it was the david lee show but that doesnt mean the contest was devoid of positive revelations for the lake show ryan kelly scored his first nba points for example the first fga of ryankelly34’s career a 3pointer off stevenash’s 4th assist swish lakers lead halfway through the 2nd q mike trudell lakersreporter october 2013and we cant forget about this xavier henry alleyoop that made the crowd go nuts henry nick young and chris kaman were the stars of the show for the purple and gold combining for points rebounds and eight assists on 19of30 shooting from the field end of updatethe great wall of china is one of the most impressive sights in the world in fact its supposed to be the only manmade object that can be seen from space even if thats nothing more than a myth as no astronaut has ever claimed to have seen it so of course the lakers went and had a gander for themselves it was a day filled with gondola rides camels and breathtaking sights and you can view kevin dings photo diary of the spectacle for yourself by clicking here however that wasnt the biggest news that ding reported during the early portion of the trip he relayed a quote from kobe that should cause lakers fans to be filled with unmitigated joy i feel pretty damn good so im going to get out today and try to move around on the court re kevinding’s quotes from kobe this optimism progress won’t surprise some inside locker room understatement he’s not a normal athlete mike trudell lakersreporter october 2013well hows that for a development kobe isnt the only one dealing with injuries though steve nash has ben dealing with an ankle injury but according to lakers coms mike trudell it looks like hell still be playing in tuesday oct 15ths preseason game against the dubs everybody but kobe practiced today for the lakers including nash ankle johnson foot farmar calf and kelly foot mike trudell lakersreporter october 2013it looks like nash and johnson will play on tuesday night we will see how farmar and kelly continue to progress mike trudell lakersreporter october 2013los angeles is already playing from behind the eight ball this season and the team needs everyone possible to be healthy nash is obviously no exception especially because its on him to make all of the rather lackluster supporting pieces look better plus the lakers need to stay away from tobogganing in the future chris kaman crushed a finger when shawne williams crashed into him according to mike bresnahan of thelos angeles times h t b rs zach buckley neither player was seriously injured but it doesnt seem as though they had as much fun as nick young ah to be in china you can also check out stephen currys diary on sfgate com for more

4 the chicago bulls biggest preseason challenge figured to be avoiding distractions duringtheir weekend trip to brazils rio de janeiro unfortunately they found one major distraction and its one that this franchise knows all too well derrick rose chicagos former mvp who missed the entire season recovering from a torn acl was held out of the nbas first game in south america even as chants of rose rose rang out late in the bulls win over the washington wizards on saturday he didnt budge the reason for his absence soreness in his left knee the same one thats cost him the last months of his playing career oh boy not again alexandre loureiro getty images but its far too early to start ringing the alarm the team called the decision to hold him out precautionary via espn com bulls executive john paxson told k c johnson of the chicago tribunethat absences like this were to be expected we never anticipated a straight line he had a little soreness and we are being ultraconservative because its the third game of preseason its to early to press anything it is minor knee soreness and were going to let him work through this the next day or two thats it after enduring a season of willheorwonthereturn questions last season roses fans or critics rather apparently cannot help themselves as rick morrissey of the chicago suntimesnoted rose haters have come out in full force since saturdays dnp knee soreness breeds fear fear causes panic and somewhere along the way that panic becomes vitriolic attacks suddenly rose is a selfish softy someone incapable of putting anything above his own demands jonathan daniel getty images its as if the 25yearold hasnt already poured four years of blood sweat and tears into the organization like he hasnt delivered a pair of central division titles or an mvp award to a franchise thats been waiting for a transcendent star since michael jordan exited in all of that hate for a teamdirected preseason dnp like rose told johnson he was ready to go if given the opportunity i couldve played but the front office made the decision to sit me out he said i cant complain about it its nothing huge i know that i should be able to go next game for anyone to think that this is entirely roses decision is ludicrous hes under the constant watch of team physician brian cole athletic trainer fred tedeschi and director of sports performance jen swansonnot to mention the coaching staff and executives that track his every move should bulls fans be worried about roses absence absolutely hes still not where he needs to be not at all this is a routine part of the process not yet but lets see what happens over the next few weeks submit votevote to see resultsshould bulls fans be worried about roses absence absolutely hes still not where he needs to be 9 not at all this is a routine part of the process 57 not yet but lets see what happens over the next few weeks 33 total votes if br polldata br polldata if br polldata br polldata id question should bulls fans be worried about roses absence choices choice0 count choice absolutely hes still not where he needs to be choice6 count choice choice1 count choice not at all this is a routine part of the process choice7 count choice choice2 count choice not yet but lets see what happens over the next few weeks choice8 count choice choice3 count choice choice9 count choice choice4 count choice choice5 count choice sidebar false if br poll br poll showresults false
4 so far this preseason a few members of the chicago bulls havent been very spectacular but hey its only preseason these games dont really count you certainly cant include derrick rose on the disappointing list in both his exhibition games this year he sat against the washington wizards due to knee soreness the mvp has shown the same quickness and speed that he possessed before the and taj gibson definitely hasnt disappointed bulls fans thus far dunking all over the place and knocking down jumpers left and right watch out carlos boozer mr gibson could snatch your starting spot in the near future so which players havent looked sharped during the preseason who isnt quite ready for opening night just yet marquis teaguemarquis teague barely played during the first two preseason games logging just six minutes against the indiana pacers and seven versus the memphis grizzlies he scored three points in the first contest and four during the second thats not bad at all seeing that he didnt play much its pretty hard to drop points when youre receiving only six minutes per game then why is he even on this list teague makes an appearance due to his performance against the wizards he played minutes in this one recording a meager four points and one assist this was his chance to show what he can do he was supposed to gain the trust of bulls coach tom thibodeau and prove that hes ready to be an impact role player unfortunately he didnt come through teague was phenomenal during the las vegas summer league averaging points and assists per contest he lit up the portland trail blazers for points looking like an elite nba point guard he needs to play like he did over the summer which was attacking the basket and setting up his teammates in order to make thibodeaus rotation luckily teague has another five preseason games to prove himself well see if he can get the done erik murphychicago used its secondround pick 49th overall in this years draft on erik murphy it was a somewhat surprising move since he isnt known for his defense which the bulls pride themselves on although he wont shut anyone down with his d and doesnt possess lebron jamestype athleticism murphy was drafted because of his ability to shoot the ball he shot percent from downtown as a senior at florida the bulls ranked 21st in threepoint percentage last season so far murphys shot isnt falling he has hit only percent of his fieldgoal attempts including percent from threepoint land and while hes receiving a decent amount of playingtime minutes per game murphy is averaging just points thibodeau didnt play his rookies jimmy butler and teague the last two seasons and they were both firstround picks so hell have to be really blown away in order to play a secondrounder however if murphys shot starts to fall as the preseason progresses he could end up cracking the regularseason rotation you know the saying never say never he has game watch him here as he dominates during a summer league contest versus the dallas mavericks tony snellwe go from one rookie to another the bulls selected tony snell 20th overall passing up a center to back up joakim noah snell cant play center but like murphy he has the abilityto shoot and also like murphy he has struggled quite a bit thus far ned dishman getty images playing nearly minutes per game snell is averaging points rebounds and two rebounds while shooting percent from the field yes you read that right percent thats not impressive by any stretch of the imagination plus he has missed all five of his threepoint attempts that means hes shooting percent from beyond the arc in case youre extremely horrible at math again its just preseason no need to worry snell has the potential to be a great pro he is a solid defender who could develop into an outstanding defender down the road especially under the tutelage of coach thibs yet in the meantime he must shake off the rookie jitters and show why he was a firstround draft pick expect snell to receive playing time for the remainder of the preseason as thibodeau looks to see exactly what the rookie brings to the table and also expect that percent to rise hes too good of a shooter

2 wilfried zaha will look to push through a loan move away from manchester united after his frustrating start to life under david moyes at old trafford since his bigmoney million move from crystal palace in the summer zaha has failed to turn out in a single competitive appearance for the champions sparking frustrations from the player that he needs to head out on loan to kickstart his career once more reports mark ogden of the telegraph the twicecapped england international who is in gareth southgates under21 squad for tuesdays fixture against lithuania at ipswich is understood to be the subject of interest from at least five premier league clubs but a return to selhurst park for play for ian holloways strugglers is not being considered newcastle west ham and fulham could offer zaha a loan move in january until the end of the season but speculation linking the player with a move to the championship with bolton managed by former palace manager dougie freedman has been ruled out with only the capital one cup tie against norwich city providing him with any realistic chance of appearing for the first team in the near future zaha has seemingly admitted that a loan move is the best way to persuade moyes that he is ready to make his mark on the team at old trafford the frustrations of zaha will likely have been enhanced by the success story of adnan januzaj who has jumped above the twicecapped england international in the attacking pecking order at united if as ogden reports a loan move is to materialize a premier league club seems his best destination zaha has spent the bulk of his career in the championship with palace and was arguably the divisions best player last season the premier league is naturally the next level for zaha to test himself at and a move to a lower premier league club could provide the winger with the opportunity to showcase his talents to moyes and england boss roy hodgson his only appearance for united this season was in the community shield victory over wigan a game which is still widely regarded as a preseason curtain raiser despite moyes claiming to the press that he was impressed with zaha during a preseason trip to the far east and australia his chances at unitedfor the time being at leastseem limited what do you think should zaha stay and fight it out for a place at old trafford or is a loan move best for both parties
2 juventus have been faced with some irritating speculation over paul pogbas longterm future during the international break and its their own fault for inviting it the former manchester united man who opted to leave old trafford on a free transfer in search of more regular playing time in has been linked with a move to arsenal and real madrid in recent months the bianconeri management should be focusing their energies on keeping him in turin for the next decade but instead club president andrea agnelli has admitted togazetta dello sport viacraig hope of thedaily mail that a bigmoney deal would be hard to resist giorgio chiellini the old ladys stellar central defender has weighed in on the subject suggesting that he too could see pogba departing for a monstrous offer he toldgazetta dello sport via thedaily mail at the moment pogba is the biggest talent in international football in his position if juve do receive an obscenely high offer for him just look at the price bale went for paul is settled here and hell probably renew his contract but you never know with the transfer market anything can happen when a club is offered an obscene amount of money for a player its difficult to say no noone can promise that a player will never be sold every player has his price thats just the way it is the fact that any player has a price and that everyone is for sale is a given in modern football as evidenced by cristiano ronaldos mammoth million sale from manchester united to real madrid why chiellini needs to regurgitate that is unclear and despite altogether not saying too much hes invited heavy unwanted speculation to the club valerio pennicino getty images juventus are in the process of phasing andrea pirlo out of his regista role and pushing pogba into a more integral one antonio conte is trying to build a future around the precocious french talent and talking about him potentially leaving is hardly the ideal stance to take chiellini says it himself pogba is the biggest talent in international football in his position perhaps notthe biggest but one of the biggest certainly and the strides he has made so far in his short career are astonishing to say the least pogba is the complete midfielder he possesses every attribute required to reach the top power aggressiveness technical talent height and speed are all his to exert and he can produce a rasping long shot to boot whether conte plans to plug him into the regista role in place of pirlo orremodelthe system around him in a different way is unclear but the obvious moves to limit pirlos influence over the teambenched for certain games contract situation unclearcan only point to the induction of pogba as a juve star the bianconeri have taken a quizzical approach to the situation one that simply invites continued speculation for the next several seasons that agnelli has said a bigmoney deal would be tough to resist is a tool international media will use against the club in future transfer windows and pogbas early ambitious move to turin speaks volumes of the confidence he has in himself it will now beexcruciating to watchthe papers to put two and two together every single transfer window from this point on juve need pogba if they are to build a uefa champions league winning side and that has to be the goal the turin giants are one of europes finest most storied clubs and the fans will not be happy selling their star assets off to vultures a stronger message in the other direction was needed on the subject of pogbas future and agnelli could live to regret his offthecuff remarks follow stighefootball
2 while a lot can change between now and january it appears manchester united winger wilfried zaha will be one of the most soughtafter players available in the winter transfer window the 20yearold who signed for united from crystal palace last january but only joined up with his new teammates in the summer has struggled to force his way into david moyes side so far this seasonstrengthening the possibility that he will be loaned out for the second half of the campaign to another premier league side zaha played a prominent role in uniteds preseason tour of asia but it has been another of the tours more impressive performers adnan januzaj who has taken that momentum into the new campaign januzajs case has been well covered the 18yearold of asyettobedefined national team allegiances taking his opportunities to impress at the club level with both hands since being thrown on as a 68thminute substitute in uniteds fourth premier league game against crystal palace harry engels getty images impressing with his threat in that cameo the teenager then became one of moyes preferred options to provide fresh legs in wide areas off the bench culminating in a first start that saw him spark a comeback in an otherwise dour performance against sunderland zaha meanwhile has been out in the cold since being an unused substitute in uniteds opening league fixture at swansea seeing nani antonio valencia and then januzaj gradually erase his opportunities there had been reports that zaha was promised involvement in the capital one cup meeting with liverpool when he sat on the bench throughout that match it only added to the concerned talk about his status speculation has been rife as to the reasons why zaha has struggled to earn moyes favour although it appears that in a similar situation to the one juan mata recently found himself in with jose mourinho at chelsea the manager wants his player to show more tactical discipline and defensive diligence zaha during his time at crystal palace and recent appearances for england under21s has shown himself to be a prodigiously gifted attacking player with a willingness to track back on behalf of his team when required but that tracking back has been done inconsistently seemingly dependent on how his performance has been going while his tricks in attack occasionally come when better passing options are present around him moyes seemingly wants him to show he has improved his decisionmaking before he is entrusted with firstteam responsibilities he is a fantastic lad but he has got to learn what his new manager wants him to do zahas old manager at palace ian holloway told the daily star recently but his ability will shine through and i am sure he will be the right player for manchester united no one said the road to success would be easy http t co if70nxnzpx wilfried zaha wilfriedzaha october 2013a loan move away from a top side has tended to be looked upon as a negative assessment of players longterm prospects at that club but united are among a number of clubs who have seen their promising youngsters benefit immensely after gaining experience at another premier league side danny welbeck sunderland jonny evans also sunderland and tom cleverley wigan have all become firstteam squad members and international players after loan spells elsewhere cleverley believes zaha would benefit from following the likes of jesse lingard angelo henriquez and nick powell who are all currently gaining firstteam experience away from old trafford i think its massive it definitely helped me cleverley told mutv i got something out of all three of my loan spells he also spent time at leicester and watford and id recommend it to any young player who is at a big club with a 25man squad the lads will gain massive confidence and they are all doing really well its pleasing to see all three of the aforementioned names are currently playing in the championship lingard at birmingham henriquez and powell at wigan lacking as they do much experience of playing at that level zaha in contrast played well over games for palace in englands second tier meaning only a move to another premier league side would make sense in terms of enhancing his development while palace would love to have their academy product back and will doubtless at least ask the question it is believed zaha is currently more intrigued by a move to newcastle the prospect of playing at newcastle is the preferred one at present but it depends on united allowing a loan move to happen the daily star has claimed they were told by a source julian finney getty images newcastles interest would seem to make sense considering manager alan pardews acknowledgement on sunday that he wanted to add a few more british faces to his frenchflavoured squad we need to look at british players because were starting to get filled up with perhaps too many foreigners pardew told sky sports show goals on sunday similarly pardew admitted that he spent much of his summer pursuing flair playersandros townsend apparently among themto complement his squad but was frustrated at almost every turn presumably then the need for such attributes rolls on into january we were after flair players and when you get into that market as a premier league club you have your league and divisions like the bundesliga chasing them because they are a rare commodity so it is difficult to get them over the line pardew noted loic remy grabbed on loan from qpr has been a great signing and given us what we didnt have last year which is a striker who can play build the game and finish while he has a nice manner is comfortable with our group and has the confidence to play for newcastle too if yohan cabaye had have gone we might have had more to play with and got a striker but im glad he stayed zaha would certainly fit the bill of a flair player and is exceedingly unlikely to head to the bundesliga instead adding to a newcastle front line that occasionally seems to start misfiring moyes may also believe pardew would be a reasonable manager to entrust the responsibility of instilling more positional discipline in zaha having seen the former west ham boss recently drop the mercurial hatem ben arfa for failing to pull his weight when his side is without the ball newcastle and united presumably have a reasonable relationship having negotiated the move of gabriel obertan between the two sides in although we can only guess whether the newcastle hierarchy remains particularly grateful at being sold the frenchman if pardew really only has limited funds zaha would be an ideal shortterm acquisition minimal cost united may not even demand a loan fee and would perhaps only ask for half of the wages to be paid to fill a need for six months at the end of that they may even be in prime position to sign zaha should moyes and united ultimately deem him not in their future plans then again january is still ten weeks away and a lot can change before then if januzaj can emerge as the next big thing for manchester united and at least six different international sides off the back of a handful of performances there is no guarantee zaha will be in the same purgatory come the end of december he may only need one opportunity and if he takes it his career at united may quickly take flight but if he has to wait a little longer a temporary move to newcastle seems to suit the needs of both him and the two clubs involved

2 toni kroos is a prime example of an outstanding player who due to a certain preferred system of play has largely found himself left out of his national team although his talent is undeniably extraordinary the bayern munich midfielder has rarely started for germany with few exceptions he has only been used in bastian schweinsteigers stead when the vicecaptain has been injured but the 23yearold kroos has been in outstanding form in recent weeks and with a slew of germany stars sidelined with injury last friday was given a rare start in a lineup that also featured schweinsteiger sami khedira and mesut ozil and he delivered a masterful performance that merited reconsideration for a starting role in joachim loews team until recently there was no place in a fullyfit germay squad for kroos to start although his short and longranged passing ability makes him ideal for the role of regista the exhansa rostock mans physical weakness and overall lack of defensive refinement makes him a poor choice as one of a pair of holding midfielders in a and he certainly has never been an option to start as the playmaker a position that since has belonged to mesut ozil kroos is best suited for the role of a no a central midfielder who plays between the purely attacking and purely defensive midfield roles among classic formations he fits best in a or behind the playmaker in a but loew found a new way for him to play on friday as germany employed a formation with ozil as the centerforward it was something out of a pep guardiola dream and it worked brilliantly germany dominated ireland taking shots and hitting the woodwork once as they scored three goals at first glance the use of ozil as the centerforward might seem completely illogical the arsenal man is by no means known for his finishing and is not remarkably strong or quick but he was closely flanked by a rightfooted leftwinger in andre schuerrle who was excellent and thomas mueller also drifted into the box from the right critical to ozils success was the steady support he had from kroos who could play in advanced midfield while having the reliable sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger as cover behind him and with three players working rather narrowly ahead of him kroos was wellshielded and had plenty of options to pick in passing surely enough it was he who assisted schuerrle and ozils goals shaun botterill getty images for one that did not include a natural striker loews formation was deceptively direct with some room for fluidity and positional interchange all four attacking players positioned themselves rather narrowly in attack width was generally provided by fullbacks philipp lahm and marcell jansen although it included loews classic emphasis on quick transitions the system germany employed against ireland conjured memories of guardiolas barcelona it remains highly uncertain whether kroos will in the long term win loews favor the talented midfielder faces direct competition from ilkay gundogan who last season cemented his role as schweinsteigers first backup when fit the dortmund man offers less quality in shooting than kroos but is a better defender and dribbler and can create play like a natural no based on skill set he is competition for kroos in the system used on friday other competition for kroos is less direct but equally threatening loews tactical setup on friday may have worked brilliantly but it was only an experiment whether or not the trainer opts to use a false striker in the long term it would require more than one good performance for him to consider scrapping the hes consistently used since germany were without mario goetze who has been used as the false striker and due to his athletic qualities is ostensibly more suited to the role than ozil marco reus is similarly an option in the striker role in which case ozil would take kroos place in attacking midfield even julian draxler is an option provided he continues his meteoric rise what is known is that kroos finally has found a role in the germany team that suits his qualities and loew has found an alternative to that offers some tactical advantages exactly how he intends to use this new option going forward remains uncertain but kroos now has every chance to convince the trainer to give it more and more consideration follow clark whitney on twitter

2 a small number of bloggers and journalists will presumably have been pretty smug on friday evening as two romelu lukaku goals confirmed belgiums place in the world cup a few years ago a few bright sparks including sites like the belgian waffle spotted that there was an uncommonly large number of brilliant young players coming through the belgian system and championed them accordingly and with players like thibaut courtois thomas vermaelen vincent kompany jan vertonghen marouane fellaini eden hazard kevin mirallas kevin de bruyne and romelu lukaku combining this made belgium everyones dark horses for years to come of course as rory smith noted in the times on monday there comes a point when a dark horse can no longer be regarded as darkat some point theyre just a horse and after their qualification with a game to spare belgium will be one of the european teams to watch in brazil this turnaround was the result of hard work and innovative thinking according to former national coach georges leekens who told the daily express this was a country where footballers had had enough of being criticised for failure we needed to change this mindset and get them to believe in themselves and most importantly get them enjoying themselves in terms of youth development we worked more on the qualities that we have and focused less on what we cant do we started to work on the positive things before we didnt have any wingers now we have three or four highquality players clive rose getty images of course others simply attributed it to that most vague of things the golden generation which comes with its own problems this is a term familiar to most and one that generally induces sighs and rolled eyes aplenty we all know about england with the likes of ashley cole steven gerrard frank lampard david beckham and wayne rooney excelling at club level leading many to assume that this talent would automatically translate to the national team as it turned out englands golden generation turned out to simply fulfil the seemingly traditional english criteria of mediocrity and semiglorious failure talking an excellent game but freezing on the biggest stage of course england werent the only ones the portuguese golden generation stemmed from an outrageouslytalented young side featuring luis figo rui costa and jorge costa winning successive world youth championships in and great things were expected of them but the best portugal could do was humiliation at the hands of greece on their own turf in the final of euro the ivory coasts team is reaching the end of its current golden generation a side featuring didier drogba emmanuel eboue and the toure brothers was expected to dominate africa and make a serious impression on the world cup but a series of disappointments in the cup of nations including two final defeats on penalties and group stage exits at germany and south africa all give the impression that this was a generation of talent wasted shaun botterill getty images holland have had any number of golden generations with the most notable of recent years the team rooted in the great ajax side of the mid90s great things were expected of the de boer brothers clarence seedorf edgar davids dennis bergkamp and patrick kluivert but again they ultimately disappointed this belgian side is of course hugely talented but history teaches us not to expect too much of them dark horses or not

2 the serie a table makes for some unlikely reading these days gone is the traditional northern dominance that so characterised italys top flight in the past for now at least the south has risen which is why the weekends game between leaders roma and secondplaced napoli is such a fascinating prospect both have started the season extremely well despite losing key players and having to adapt to new managers and both look certain to be challenging for one of serie as three champions league places but are either good enough to take the fight to juventus the winner at the stadio olimpico will have a strong case its early days yet but so impressive have both the giallorossi and the partenopei been that it is now impossible to say for sure that they cant challenge for a title for napoli its hardly surprising aurelio de laurentiis has been building steadily for years at the san paolo and in recent seasons the azzurri never seemed far off now with a more balanced squad and with rafa benitez at the helm they look the complete package romas bright start has been a little more of a shock its been a difficult few years for the romans and while the new american ownership has been working hard to turn roma into a successfuland profitableforce in italian and european football following years of decline under rosella sensi the results have lagged far behind the ambition at least until rudi garcia showed up the frenchman has had an immediate impact leading the club to seven straight wins not only is that a club record its an achievement so rare that history suggests fans are right to start dreaming of league glory of the teams who managed to win seven in a row at the beginning of a seasonjuventus in and milan in and inter in 1966onlyhelenio herreras great nerazzurri side failed to win the league they did however finish second and as runnersup in the european cup roma dont have european football to contemplate but if youd asked them at the start of the season theyd have happily emulated that inter side of second place and champions league football for wouldconstitute a hugely successful season for roma as they look to reestablish themselves among the european elite rightly or wrongly romanisti and commentators everywhere are now daring to expect more from garcias men thats the nature of the sport that european spot had seemed an unlikely dream after two disappointing seasonsbut now its the least it will take to satisfy expectations napoli are the acid test if garcia can best benitez anythings possible the spaniard has an excellent team at his disposal in naples and they remain the most obvious threat to antonio contes juve but with the league and european football to contend with there is a danger that the azzurri might be overstretched later in the campaign juventus have a bigger better squad and roma have only one target for the season benitez can illafford to drop points at this stage to a rival should the visitors claim a win at the olimpico theyll be in the driving seat for the championship too victories dont come easy in the italian capitala scalp there would be a massive confidence boost ahead of their trip to turin to face juve in november for their part juve must travel to florence and face vincenzo montellas attractive andcombative fiorentina a favourable result is far from a sure thing victory at the olimpico then could see either roma or napoli steal an early march on the defending champions its incredible how much has changed in rome after a season to forget the first few games on romas streak were dismissedor at least downplayedbecause they came against easy opposition but convincing wins against lazio in the derby and inter away from home confirmed the lupi as more than flattrack bullies if they can winor at least drawagainst napoli theyll be confirmed as contenders and the romanisti will be right to dream tell me what you think on twitter follow colliobrien
2 what england vs poland world cup qualifierwhen tuesday october 15th p m bst p m edt where wembley stadium londonafter nine occasionally fraught often mundane qualification matches it all comes down to the 10th and lastwith england knowing only a win against poland on tuesday is guaranteed to send them to next summers world cup back during the qualification process for the tournament fabio capello could afford a loss in englands penultimate match and still make it to the promised land having won all nine of the other games in the group alas after four draws this time around roy hodgson knows he is afforded no such luxurya first defeat almost certainly sending the three lions to the unpredictable purgatory of the playoffs that is assuming ukraine one point behind defeat san marino in their final gamebut with san marino having lost all nine of their other encounters by an average margin of five goals that is not much of an assumption to make much has been made of who england could face should they be forced into such a twolegged affairfrance appearing one likely optionbut hodgson will not be devoting much thought to that just win on tuesday and all else is irrelevant group h

half of this international break defeating montenegro at wembley but poland did nota narrow defeat to ukraine ending their slim world cup qualification hopes while that means they have nothing tangible to play for on tuesday they will still come eager to impresswith polish fans expected to form the largest away support wembley has seen in many years proud of the indys brilliant sport front cover today what exactly is international football meant to be about pic twitter com modmayizib jack pittbrooke jackpittbrooke october 2013poland also have a proud history of scuppering english plans drawing with england in similar circumstances back in to force the three lions to miss the world cup i cant imagine they will take their foot off the pedal hodgson said on friday as reported by itv com they will want to come here and get another good result just like poland did in we are going to be preparing for the very best poland can be if we are lucky and they decide not to turn up and allow us to stroll through them so be it but i am not expecting it polands danger man is borussia dortmund striker robert lewandowski who has expressed a desire for his side to produce a big performance both for themselves and for the many polish fans who will be in attendance adam nurkiewicz getty images we wont be favourites and we dont stand a chance of going through but we want to go to wembley and at least allow our supporters a little fun lewandowski said speaking to the daily telegraph i dont know why we have good players at top clubs but we dont have a team who can play ruthless football and kill teams off robert lewandowskis club teammate jakub blaszczykowski is another of polands better players although the absence of a third dortmund employee lukasz piszczek should be a relief for england at goalkeeper is where england fans might be most familiar with polands options with all three players plying their trade in the premier league arsenal duo wojciech szczesny and lukasz fabianski are both in the squad but it is currently southamptons artur boruc who possesses the no spot and he will be looking to emulate jan tomaszewskithe clown as brian clough dubbed him who denied england in 1973by frustrating england we are still talking about that tomaszewskis performance in poland and im hoping to do the same kind of thing boruc told the daily mail at the weekend i know its not the same because this time we cant qualify but at the very least if im playing in that game i want to stop england tomaszewski is not convinced however believing borucs defence is not up to the challenge of protecting him from the likes of wayne rooney daniel sturridge and danny welbeck artur is one of the best keepers in the world said tomaszewski to the bbc but can he stop england on his own no i made mistakes in but my teammates saved us our defence isnt so good now artur must rely on himself michael steele getty images a lot at stakenot only is world cup qualification on the agenda so is englands shortterm fixture list involvement in a playoff scuppers provisional plans in place for november friendlies against argentina and germany per thedaily telegraph two illustrious meetings that will add to the football associations 150year celebrations similarly failing to book a world cup berth delays englands options of booking a preferential world

late header from kamil glik earned poland a deserved point in a game that was delayed for hours due to heavy rain joe harts inability to come and connect with a poland corner allowed glik to score after rooney had notched in the first half jermain defoe who started the match and rooney were guilty of wasting other good openings its my fault hart said afterwards i should have punched it or stayed in goal i didnt do either and it cost us how they will line upthe continued absence of ashley cole with a rib injury means leighton baines will continue at leftback absolving hodgson of one particular headache the other surrounds whether to stick with andros townsend attempting to repeat the welcome response his selection brought on friday hodgson professed himself extremely impressed with the spurs wingers performance but the attacking presence of blaszczykowski on polands right wing might tempt hodgson to play milnerwho he nearly picked over townsend on fridayas a more defensively disciplined option milners presence would require one of townsend and welbeck to be dropped but the manchester united striker has been a favourite of hodgsons since his appointment making the new boy the more likely to be sacrificed then again it is a win england really need meaning the mindset remains similar to the montenegro game and thus the team is likely to remain similar in all likelihood the only change will be at rightback where the suspended kyle walker is replaced by phil jones england joe hart leighton baines phil jagielka gary cahill phil jones steven gerrard frank lampard danny welbeck wayne rooney andros townsend daniel sturridge poland artur boruc grzegorz wojtkowiak kamil glik lukasz szukala artur jedrzejczyk waldemar sobota mariusz lewandowski mateusz klich gregorz krychowiak jakub blaszczykowski robert lewandowski scott heavey getty images predictionpoland in many ways are a similar outfit to montenegro blessed with some talented players but clearly deficient in some areas of their xi and lacking in real depth england will see their defence as a unit that can be easily breached although robert lewandowski will be encouraged by the fact englands defence was also unable to keep a clean sheet on friday amid a boisterous atmosphere at wembley expect englands wealth of attacking options to eventually break down polands resistance although maybe not without some fraught moments as robert lewandowski noted in qualification victories and points are the most important things not the style of play at no point will that be in sharper focus than on tuesday predicted score england poland
4 there was not a more cohesive unit in the nba last season than the golden state warriors management was on the same page with a perfect mix of players in the locker room from a complementary coaching staff to an unselfish offense and an i got your back defense the warriors had better chemistry than walter white its no coincidence that this group became the first warriors team to make the playoffs since and the second since this would appear to be a great sign for the team entering season the problem with chemistry however is that the same mixture of elements doesnt necessarily continue to cause the same reaction after a period of time passes im no science expert but think of it in terms of a baking soda and vinegar volcano although the exact same elements continue to interact after the eruption the result is far less impressive in other words the best thing the warriors could have done to maintain a high level of team chemistry was to significantly alter what made them so successful last year that is exactly what they did last years perfect potion is no longer rocky widner getty images jarrett jack and carl landry were vital to golden states loose locker room and cohesive style of play last season the rest of the roster was young lacked playoff experience and was short on leadership this made jack and landry of the utmost importance each was a vocal veteran role player who was talented enough to lead by example yet not so good that he impeded on the development of the teams upandcoming stars jack and landrys specific skill sets also fit the roster perfectly jack had the ability to create his own shot and set up others allowing youngsters stephen curry and klay thompson to play off the ball landry was a ferocious offensive rebounder and inside scorer which drew attention away from the youthful backcourt the coaching staff featured a similar dynamic assistant coach mike malone was the strategic leader of the staff his defensive brilliance greatly complementing head coach mark jacksons role as a motivator and mentor jack is now in cleveland while landry and malone are in sacramento also gone are andris biedrins brandon rush and richard jefferson traded to the utah jazz those three made little to no impact on the court but the latter two seemingly had a significant role in the teams success rushs acl injury served as motivational tool for several players while jefferson was the teams elder statesman and token washedup bench veteran seriously every good team has one and most bad teams do not despite the contributions that these six men brought to oakland the warriors were right to let them all go malones departure was inevitable as he had been the best assistant coach in the league for several seasons landry and jack were no longer as crucial from a leadership standpoint and both were coming off what was likely their peak seasons physically throwing a combined million at the two jack got million from the cavs landry got million from the kings would not have made any sense for four years of declining oncourt performance and a dwindling need for their intangibles trading jefferson and biedrins was a nobrainer when the opportunity arose due to their combined million in dead salary and throwing rush in was a small price to pay considering what the warriors got back new faces will fit right in rocky widner getty images the warriors offseason can be broken down bit by bit but the quantum move that was the difference between improvement and regression was the signandtrade that brought in andre iguodala the 29yearold wing is obviously a huge addition due to his raw abilities alone hes an elite defender at two positions an allworld finisher at the rim an excellent rebounder and passer a tremendous transition threat and a superb slasher all superlatives aside though iguodalas addition is about so much more than his skill set its about not only replacing but revamping the chemistry of golden states roster iguodala instantly fills in for jack as a great secondary ball handler and facilitator that can get curry and thompson the ball in catchandshoot situations he unseats thompson as the teams best perimeter defender which will allow the young shooting guard to save more energy for the offensive end he ostensibly replaces harrison barnes as the teams starting small forward in turn allowing barnes to become one of most dynamic if not the most dynamic sixth men in the nba in fact barnes ability to shoot and create his own shot attack the rim post up run the floor rebound and defend are reasons to believe that this years golden state sixth man will be almost as good as the two they had last season combined the presence of iguodala on the roster and salarycap space opened up to get himfive spots and over million in a ptojrvyrf salaryallowed the warriors to fill out their bench exactly how they wanted the combination of having an incredibly strong top six a players coach and money to spend helped the warriors add marreese speights jermaine oneal and toney douglas whereas most teams must settle for whatever mediocre players are willing to accept the minutes available to them and the roster around them the warriors were able to hand pick three guys who not only fit in perfectly on the court but whose personalities will play a big role in formulating elite team chemistry rocky widner getty images oneal is essentially an improved jefferson the 35yearold big man is certainly a shell of his former self but his former self was an allnba power forward he can still defend the rim rebound and score inside better than most backup centers in the league perhaps more importantly oneal is extremely wise experienced and well spoken if jack and landry were no longer needed as leaders because they had already raised the team up to their level then oneal is the perfect guy to take it a step further as hes enjoyed far more individual team success over the years than jack and landry combined douglas and speights may not be huge locker room presences but that should be a positive chemistry wise with david lee curry iguodala and oneal in line to become the clubhouse leaders of this team adding role players who simply help the team on the court is the best option too many voices can become problematic repeat elite cohesion the warriors were one of the most active teams during the offseason adding and subtracting five new and old players respectively the reason that the team again looks to have a great mix of players both on and off the court is a coaching staff front office and ownership that all have excellent chemistry themselves mark jackson knows exactly what type of players he can coach up and effectively use in his rotations talent evaluator jerry west can determine what players will and wont fit what jackson is looking for general manager bob myers can then go out and strike a shrewd deal to bring in the right guy and owners joe lacob and peter guber are willing to dish out the dough as they completely trust their front office team chemistry can be somewhat unpredictable of course and one illfitting element can cause devastating reactions still theres no reason to believe that the warriors will have oncourt or locker room issues not with the abundance of talent complementary skill sets and positive personalities they have left and right on the contrary this years team may have even better chemistry than last years after all the procedure for concocting the winning formula is simple form bonds win strengthen bonds win more strengthen more etc the key ingredient there is winningsomething a team with stephen curry andre iguodala david lee andrew bogut klay thompson and harrison barnes is likely to do an abundance of
2 the international fortnight is a time when football fans up and down the country lament the lack of action on a saturday and sunday and monday evening and mock the value of europes best players lining up against postmen from san marino some those actually with an interest in internationals may cast an eye towards next summers world cup in brazil while others those of us who no longer value internationals pine for the return of premier league action meanwhile with no football reports to fill sundays backpages the tabloid news desks are left with a tricky dilemma just how will they fill their pages this weekend saw the sunday mirror follow a simple tried and tested formula to solve their problem they wrote about luis suarez their chief football writer paul smith wrote that liverpool are planning for life without 50millionrated striker luis suarez claiming that suarez has confided in friends that he remains determined to quit the redsand join a club that will challenge for major honours if suarez were to leave he would be eligible to play for a champions league side in the last of the competition such a report containing no quotes was quickly followed up by an anfield source denying this as per espn possibly whats most incredible is that people actually believe that liverpool would be prepared to sell suarez alex livesey getty images after john henrys impressive handling of the situation in the summer and insistence that the uruguayan wouldnt leave just why on earth would the owner then decide that halfway through a key season would be an appropriate time to sell one of the best players in the world quite simply he wouldnt indeed nobody in their right frame of mind would as has been well documented suarez is forming an impressive partnership alongside daniel sturridgea partnership that many think could be key to liverpool achieving their goal of returning to the top four that top four equals champions league qualification and with it the riches prestige and status of being among europes elite if brendan rodgers side should qualify it would lead to a summer free from reports of players wishing to leave for champions league football or not wanting to join because of the lack of it for the first time since qualify for the champions league have steven gerrard stand in front of the kop with suarez and tell him imagine this place on a european night suarez is going nowhere
4 like every other team in the nba the los angeles lakers have been using the preseason as a means to organize their rotation and feature the standout players on the roster while the incumbent starters have obviously been on a minutes cap the more evenly distributed minutes have allowed the lakers to really tinker with their lineups the lakers have had their fair share of surprising performances during the preseason players who were on the edge of the rotation may have earned themselves some tangible amounts of playing time once the regular season rolls around nick youngnick young has been an offensive force during the preseason failing to score more than points only once during the first four games young has brought his fearless shooting to the lakers in spades hitting on of his shot attempts young may need to increase his efficiency if he wishes to really separate himself from jodie meeks as the primary backup for kobe bryant once he returns despite shooting only percent from the field young has showed his versatility by scoring from the perimeter attacking the paint and finishing in transition nick young finishing in transition the lakers have been playing young at the and he may have played his way into becoming the incumbent starter at the small forward position standing he has the height length and quickness to play well against the smaller forwards in the league however billed at only pounds he may have a hard time defending bigger forwards such as lebron james although young has stood out on the offensive end of the floor he needs to focus on rebounding the basketball better while his assist totals may be understandably low due to his role as a scorer rather than a facilitator young has to learn to clean the glass if he is going to play as a forward chris kamankaman has been a pleasant surprise for the lakers despite his injuryplagued season with the dallas mavericks last year kaman has come on strong and showed off every aspect of his game chris kaman showing off his jumper averaging a little less than eight rebounds per game during the games he has played thus far kamans presence on the boards will be very important for the lakers defense if they intend to make up for the losses of dwight howard and metta world peace he has also been a consistent scorer averaging points per game during the preseason these statistics have been accumulated while playing a little over minutes per game chris kaman setting an unused pick and finishing at the rim kaman has showed off his patented midrange jumper as well as his ability to move without the ball and finish in the interior he seems to be building a nice offensive rapport with pau gasol expect kamans numbers to eclipse the 30minute mark if he can stay healthy this season pau gasolperhaps the biggest standout on the roster is gasol who has come back strong from an injuryriddled season looking like the former allstar he once was gasol has been scoring rebounding and passing the ball very well as the focal point of the offense gasol has averaged points per game while scoring on pickandrolls jumpers and postups he has also averaged three assists per game showing that his passing touch and high basketball iq havent atrophied like his knees did last season pau gasol making plays out of the post along with the black mamba gasol will be the biggest key to the lakers success this season being the secondbest offensive playerand perhaps the best rebounding presenceon the team gasol is essential to the lakers system on both ends of the court possibly due to the minutes restriction placed upon him during the preseason gasol has been lithe and healthy during his time on the court while the defense is definitely expected to drop off without superman and world peace gasol can try to cancel out some of those losses if he and kaman can develop a cohesion on both ends of the court chris kaman and pau gasol developing chemistry they have already seemed to click on the offensive end of the court and both players are very capable rebounders if gasol and kaman are able to play off of each other in a similar manner thatmarc gasol and zach randolph do it will give bryant a very capable second option on offense when the defenses are zoning in on him
4 three games into the preseason there have been plenty of positives but also a few negatives for the houston rockets while many players are off to hot starts others have been struggling thus far and will need to pick up the pace some of the role players on houstons bench havent been contributing as much as coach kevin mchale would like them to its still very early and all the new guys have to find their niches in the rotation and build chemistry before everything starts clicking here are rockets players who need to step up before the regular season rolls around terrence jonesjones is one of three guys who are competing for the starting role at power forward and so far he is not exactly winning in three preseason games jones is averaging points and rebounds after a solid first outing against the new orleans pelicansin which he scored points he hasnt scored more than five since his games overseas against the indiana pacers have been lessthanimpressive while other rockets are doing well greg smith has hardly played due to a hip injury so its hard to tell whether he will get back in the mix for the starting job donatas motiejunas had a rough first game after fouling out but has looked good in the past two he scored and points in each of those respective games and his percent fieldgoal percentage is respectable he still needs to work on his rebounding and defense but rockets fans are definitely pleased with what they have been seeing jones can still win the starting gig but he has to turn things up a notch he was just 1of8 from the field last game which is not good enough to earn the job he needs to shoot better and have a bigger impact while he is on the floor if he wants to prove to mchale that he belongs ronnie brewer bill baptist getty images brewer is a great defender but he has to be able to score to stay in the game for the rockets the rockets added brewer to the roster this summer to help with their pitiful perimeter defense his main role is to defend opposing playmakers brewer is not expected to be a scorer but he has to do better than what hes done so far he only has six points in all three games combined and has room for improvement in other stat categories as well the rockets have a highpowered offense that likes to run up the scoreboard and having a weak link in the lineup could ruin the offensive rhythm if brewer wants to get consistent minutes each night he has to work on his offensive game houston cant afford to have him in the game if he isnt able to score the ball when given the opportunity brewers minutes will most likely be limited to big defensive possessions during the gameunless he can improve his shooting isaiah canaan bill baptist getty images canaan has had a rocky start to his rookie preseason the rockets only draft pick this summer has the potential to be a key impact player down the road but canaan has not proved himself yet in his first games of nba action canaan has yet to score a single point as a rocket he has played for a very limited amount of time but it still is not a good sign that he hasnt even made a single shot canaan was a terrific scorer last year for murray state and the rockets want him to fill that same role in the nba odds are canaan will spend the majority of the year with the rio grande valley vipers in the dleague the rockets have a lot of depth at point guard with jeremy lin patrick beverley and aaron brooks all ahead of canaan the only way he will get any playing time is if there are any injuries in the rockets backcourt canaan will get his chance one day but he will have to show a lot of improvement in the meantime

2 by all accounts the first half of the united states final home match of the hex against jamaica in kansas city on friday night was just plain awful because of the wretched firsthalf form of the yanks the biggest star in the starting lineup that night landon donovan was taken off by manager jurgen klinsmann at halftime for graham zusi instantly a number of questions began to swirl around the situation given the rocky history between donovan and klinsmann ever since the midfielders selfimposed soccer sabbatical to cambodia during the major league soccer offseason klinsmann has made donovan earn his spot in the starting ever since and up until friday the los angeles galaxy playmaker had stepped up and delivered quality performance after quality performance donovan was forced to earn his spot in the first team back by playing in the concacaf gold cup this summer and he passed that test with flying colors after his rampant run through the gold cup donovan was placed back in the spot where mostly everyone believes he belongs the starting of an important world cup qualifying match however fridays match was a setback for one of the most scrutinized figures to ever put on an american soccer jersey donovan who was removed from the squad ahead of tuesdays clash with panama at the estadio rommel fernandez was replaced by the player who most believe is in direct competition for a starting spot with the wily veteran usmnt j klinsmann announces changes to roster besler donovan howard jones depart s johnson added read why http t co 5erp1qvhkm u s soccer ussoccer october 2013zusi has had the best months of his career at the club level with sporting kansas city and at the international level with the yanks it was donovan who denied zusi of a starting spot on friday in where both players needed to have a good showing to impress the german manager in the teams buildup to the fifa world cup in brazil zusis performance in front of his home fans at sporting park was the polar opposite of the one turned in by donovan as he was a dominant force in attack for most of the second half the 27yearold zusi was rewarded for his efforts with a goal in the 77th minute that sent one of the best soccer stadiums in america into a frenzy watch gzusi opens the scoring for the usmnt at sportingpark http t co e0omeizgw2 usavjam u s soccer ussoccer october 2013zusi will get another chance to prove his worth to klinsmann without donovan in the squad on tuesday night in a match that can not be deemed irrelevant from the american perspective despite the team having already clinched a world cup berth and first place in the hex klinsmann will get a chance to examine every minute detail of his squad over the next nine months and donovans benching is a clear sign to every player who dons a united states shirt that no one will receive special treatment based on what they have done in the past benching donovan at halftime of the jamaica match was a perfect wakeup call delivered by klinsmann to his star player the benching came in a match where the entire team was underperforming and despite not wearing the captains armband donovan was one of the leaders out on the pitch that night by showing that he is not afraid to bench one of his superstars klinsmann also sent a message to the entire team that no one player is bigger than the team kevork djansezian getty images the benching should not be a blow to the confidence of donovan who has been in excellent form in the past six months as we have seen from the last time that klinsmann delivered a message to donovan the 31yearold is not afraid to go out on the pitch and prove his manager wrong time after time while we may never see klinsmann and donovan become best friends we will look back on this moment and realize how much of a motivator the former germany manager can be as he will undoubtedly get even more out of donovan the next time he plays for the united states do you think landon donovans benching was a wakeup call of sorts leave me a comment below or drop me a comment on twitter jtansey90
2 the return of domestic football is always welcome following an international break regular competitive action stretched across the entire weekend is what we all love to see and no doubt there will be plenty of headlines to discuss after next weekends games with that in mind lets take a look at some players who look set to make a major impression in week of the premier league season adnan januzaj michael regan getty images the 18yearold is the man on everyones lips at the minute having sparked a wideranging debate regarding nationality januzaj of course is eligible to play for a host of different countries and has yet to choose anyone to play for on the international stage what stemmed this debate and something that seems to have been somewhat overlooked was januzajs sensational showing in uniteds last premier league encounter at sunderland the youngster put in a superb showinginspiring his team to a winand he looked like his teams most pertinent attacking throughout the contest upstaging senior men like wayne rooney and robin van persie next up for januzaj and united is mauricio pochettinos southampton the saints are flying high in the table but their unique pressing style could see them leave plenty of space on the huge old trafford pitch if united can work the ball out of defense then their more creative players will have plenty of space to work in that includes januzaj and he will continue to impress here with another strong showing ross barkley jan kruger getty images barkley and lukaku should be too much for hull city the everton youngsters seriously impressive early season form has already earned him comparisons with paul gascoigne and michael ballack and he has been key to evertons excellent start under roberto martinez barkley has already netted twice in the opening seven games and looks to be developing an excellent understanding with onloan romelu lukaku in evertons last encounter against manchester city barkley did look a bit jaded in the latter stages but the international break will give him the opportunity to recharge and come into evertons next game at home to hull in fine fettle hull have begun the season well under steve bruce but the combination of barkley and lukaku will be too much for them to handle especially in front of the goodison park crowd alvaro negredo alex livesey getty images negredo is fast getting to grips with english football after finding himself on the bench in the infancy of his manchester city career alvaro negredo is beginning to show what he can do in the premier league his powerful aggressive style of forward play looked tailormade to the english game and in his past few games he has really started to showcase that negredo has scored two in two for city with his manofthematch performance against everton a particular highlight he also netted for the national team earlier in the week as spain beat belarus in their world cup qualifying group city travel to west ham on saturday evening in what promises to be a physical contest that the spaniard should relish his holdup play will be key here against a hammers side that buoyed after their stunning win at white hart lane in week negredo certainly has the physicality to compete with west ham defenders winston reid and james tomkins but his intelligent movement and quality on the ball will see him emerge as a key figure for city if they are to bag a win at the boleyn ground
2 manchester citys list of winners and losers thus far this season brings to mind a question posed by the social distortion song of the same name are you happy now with all the choices youve made if the club was not in outright turmoil in may it was not far off but there was risk in dismissing manchester citys most successful manager in more than years and bringing in over100 million worth of new players the team as constructed before all the changes had finished second in the premier league and lost the fa cup final in the final minutes of the match manchester city are still in the incipient stages of their current season with only seven premier league matches and two champions league appearances in the books still it is not too early to assess which citizens are feeling fine and which ones might prefer a restart of the season winnersyaya toure after manchester city dropped over50 million on fernandinho and jesus navas there may have been some questions as to who would serve as manchester citys preeminent midfielder to which toure has effectively said meet the new boss toure leads manchester city in all competitions in goals scored not sergio aguero edin dzeko or alvaro negredotoure alvaro negredo negredo came to manchester city on a deal that cost the club north of20 million but started the season third on the striker depth chart behind aguero and edin dzeko it took just three matches for negredo to establish himself as nobodys backup negredo had a goal improperly flagged for offside in the opener against newcastle united but each of the goals he scored thereafter at cardiff city and at the etihad against hull city stood he also potted a crucial equalizer in manchester citys recent defeat of everton shaun botterill getty images every time negredo kisses his wrist after scoring a goal an angel gets its wings manchester citys plans going forward will involve negredo to a far more significant degree than one might have thought in july samir nasri not to blow my own horn but one of my better calls this season was definitely nasri over navas my reasoning was that nasri was only two years removed from being a24 million acquisition that he ended up in roberto mancinis doghouse did not make him unique since half the squad ended up there at one time or another nasri has flourished beyond expectations under manuel pellegrini noting per richard jolly of espnfc com that he is more confident with this manager he has given me a lot of freedom recovering some of nasris value has been one of pellegrinis best tricks thus far manuel pellegrini manchester citys new manager accepted his job knowing that it came preloaded with insane expectations for that matter the expensive summer transfer haul was both a blessing and a curse if pellegrini could not win with these players what good was he unquestionably there have been a few disappointing results the loss at cardiff city and the draw at stoke city were poor performances and manchester city were run out of their own park against bayern munich in a champions league group stage match when manchester city play at their optimum capacity though they are positively terrifying ask newcastle united manchester united and viktoria plzen for details losersjoe hart lost in the chaos of last seasons implosion at manchester city was the subtle slippage of harts form shaun botterill getty images hart cannot catch a cold right now and that is a huge problem for city with his squad firming up nicely in front of him harts now very dubious play is no longer obscured soft goals conceded against aston villa bayern munich and everton in manchester citys last three matches have restored the timbre of the voices calling for hart to improve or be benched javi garcia at this point it is more appropriate to pity garcia than to scorn him so calling him a loser here feels harsh it is not really garcias fault that he can neither crack citys stacked midfield nor play effectively out of position as a centreback every time vincent kompany pulls a muscle which is like every week manchester city have probably run out of options with garcia though and he should probably be moved in the january transfer window for his own sake and for the good of the club jesus navas in fairness navas has been a sky blue for only a few months he still has plenty of time to find his way in manchester thus far though navas has underwhelmed chris brunskill getty images sure navas can run fast and dribble city need him to do more than that when you spend15 million on a onedimensional player you expect him to display that dimension quickly and to great effect but navas a speedy winger brought in to provide width and pace has struggled to mesh with manchester citys elite strikers and the midfielders he shares the center of the pitch with joleon lescott like nasri lescott was buried on manchester citys bench by roberto mancini last season an inmate without possibility of parole unlike nasri lescott did little with the reprieve pellegrinis arrival gave him injuries to kompany and matija nastasic early in the season combined with the new managers arrival gave lescott the opening he needed to reestablish himself as a solid if not elite centreback regrettably lescott has been ineffective in the matches he has played with so much of the season remaining to play none of the individuals listed can either rest on their accomplishments or resign themselves to failure for this lists losers though it is getting late early
4 sample size is always important to consider but through the first week of the preseason some new york knicks have already gotten off to an inauspicious beginning the team has at least one roster slot available to training camp hopefuls and is desperate for depth behind tyson chandler at the center position a slew of guards also have a chance at cracking the final roster as well conversely several knicks have opened eyes with impressive allaround play including iman shumpert and tim hardaway jr but others who will soak up the unfortunate spotlight ahead just havent done enough to warrant serious consideration for the final roster chris smith pgits possible that chris smithas marc berman of the new york postspeculated months agowas brought in as an act of good faith to the smith family his older brother j r has a history of doing right by the organization and helping out with teamfriendly contracts so the story could possibly have legs there isnt a whole lot in chris smiths basketball past that hints he may be nba material but the organization seems to be playing along like hes got a real shot so well do the same coach mike woodson ran smith out for five minutes towards the tail end of the preseason opener against the boston celtics through his first four minutes he sported a plus minus of minus24 mark l baerusa today sports smith is perhaps the biggest longshot to make the final knicks roster his only attempt from the fielda threepointerfailed he pulled a rebound and recorded a foul in the oct matchup woodson called upon toure murry instead of smith in the closing minutes against the toronto raptors in smiths second game leaving smith with the dreaded preseason dnpcd the way the roster is expected to shake outwith one orpossiblya pair of roster spaces available if the team cuts injured center jeremy tylerpresuming that more than one guard will make the final cutwould be unwise smith found his way into the teams second bout with boston on oct he went 1of3 from the field in eight minutes and grabbed two rebounds his plus minus was minus14 based off smiths lack of preseason burn and lack of results when he has been out there theres very little chance the 26yearold plays in the nba any time soon let alone on the knicks 15man roster cole aldrich ccole aldrich is one of the three centertype invites the team brought in as potential relief for tyson chandler the knicks lack of depth throughout last year was a direct cause of chandlers physical breakdown near the end of the regular season besides 35yearold kenyon martin the team would be wise to add another big body to the depth chart and you cant say theyre not trying but aldrich to this point hasnt done anything to stand out from the competitionwhich consists of josh powell and ike diogu both thats not to say his competition has been all that fierceit hasnt neither powell or diogu havent achieved a whole lot this preseason but theyve both received more time from woodson aldrich has logged an average of just over minutes in three games while powell has averaged including a start diogu logged minutes against the celts on oct aldrich has shot just 2of7 averaged four boards and looked out of sorts on defense hes combined for one block and two steals over the trio of matchups thus far powell and diogu have both gotten extended ingame looks aldrich hasnt as the heart of the preseason schedule approaches over the next two weeks knicks starters can expect more gamelong rests this opens up more chances for aldrich to get a better look from the staff and possibly even a start or two but where we stand now aldrich has been overmatched on both ends of the court which is discouraging considering the 24yearold presents the most ideal size of all camp invites at andrea bargnani pfas is stands now andrea bargnani is set to start at power forward for the knicks this benefits the team according to his supporters in the following ways he can stretch the floor for carmelo anthony to work inside he can penetrate off the dribble and he can knock down the threeball as a knick its important for bargnani to realize hell be responsible for far less than he was in toronto now the 7footer is merely an accessorysomething for the offense to fall back on because of this he can focus solely on what it takes to be the successful secondary piece new york needs this preseason while on the court with anthony and other likely starters bargnani has failed to do this countless times in just two games with melo tyson chandler and the like suited up the ball has found bargnani for an open three attempt only for il mago to pump fake put the ball on the floor and loft a shot from the midrange below courtesy of nba com are bargnanis percentages from that area midrange jumpers let alone contested ones like the ones bargnani has been attempting are the least efficient shots a player can take being able to put the ball on the floor and draw fouls is certainly a coveted skill but bargnani needs to be wary of turning down the highestpercentage look of a possession also known as pablo prigioni syndrome which at times can be the open three its fairly simple bargnani just needs to get used to doing less the sudden change of roles wont be easy to adjust to and the italian scorer is proving that early on but if he can work out the kinks now in time for opening night he has a chance to be one of the more effective role players in the east its also worth noting that bargnanis threeball much like last season hasnt been finding the bottom of the net very often hes shot just 1of7 from beyond the arc as a knick and sank just percent of threes last season with toronto hopefully for new york a healthy and motivated bargnani can improve on those numbers in time for the regular season if he can shore up the longball and trim the fat from his offensive game bargnani could have what it takes to be the secondary scorer new york needs

1 roger federer and paul annacone ended a threeyear relationship that saw the swiss champion claim the wimbledon title and weeks with the no ranking federer must now make several decisions about ending his career and will likely be seeking a new kind of direction with his choice of coach tennis writer jon wertheim goaded speculation with humor federers next coach a lane kiffin b lovie smith c dusty baker d george karl e darren cahill jon wertheim jon wertheim october 2013but in all seriousness does federer really need a coach coach federer in 2004its been a decade since young federer took over the tennis world he dismissed coach peter lundgren late in and then proceeded to dominate the atp tour with three grand slam titles in he did it without a coach indeed times were different in most noticeably for federer who had a 22yearold body and everything to gain he and girlfriend mirka vavrinec did it their way managing the scheduling and travel demands federers training regimen and even the media all they did was win titles and establish the groundwork for one of the greatest careers in tennis history though federer has had plenty of coaches and assistance before and after he has always shown the capacity to understand his objectives he is a problem solver on the court and with making career adjustments he learned to benefit from every source he tapped into but he also has a strong independent determination to succeed and knows what he must do coach or no coach nobody is going to give him a magic formula to turn the tables on rafael nadal or push aside novak djokovic could a coach rejuvenate a new kind of energyin him for whats in a coach how much effect does a coach have on a players success does a coach have the most impact on a players training and the xs and os of strategic adjustments is the coach primarily there for guidance and motivation is he more strategist or psychologist there are countless layers to any playercoach relationship depending greatly upon the players needs in brad gilbert was lauded for helping andre agassi to be more patient with gilberts winning ugly mentality he was also a stable influence for his talented but erratic pupil pete sampras had his greatest career results with annacone who constantly directed sampras to use his serve and volley to pressure opponents near the end of his career sampras had separated with annacone but struggled with his game and personal confidence they reunited and they had a fairytale ending with the u s open title recently former superstar ivan lendl was praised for helping andy murray find greater toughness and a more aggressive offense to win two grand slam titles so a coach matters or at least we would like to believe so but does it matter for federer at age new or old direction when federer dominated tennis from he did not need to radically change his game he always looked to improve with tweaks and strategy counters against specific opponents but as the best player in the world he needed only to stay the course for as long as he could dominate now age and injuries have taken a toll on federer for what has been a difficult he has not been able to play at full strength very often younger players no longer fear his past legacy mark dadswell getty images he experimented with a larger racket in the summer but returned to his familiar stick for the u s open its unclear what his plan will be with his racket maybe now is the best time to sort through any ambiguities and find his own course federer may not be ready to pick up another coach he will need the right fit someone who can work with a veteran superstar to provide the confidence and adjustments necessary to compete at the top one more time maybe the right fit is federer teaming with mirka who is now his wife she has been with him since the beginning and has studied everything there is to know about federers matches would they prefer to do things their own way find hitting partners and throw themselves at the world with their own attack if federer were to hit the tape without a coach it wouldnt be the most unusual move in his career coach or no coach tennis outcomes will still come down to roger federer
4 the season just may be the most important for dwyane wade and the legacy he plans on leaving once he steps away from the nba sure hes won backtoback titles with south beach buddy lebron james but his onthecourt production took a hit last season during the miami heats postseason run he averaged points assists and five rebounds per game last year during the regular season not to mention he shot an impressive percent from the field as well during the postseason though wade was a different player averaging just points per game on percent shooting from the field that steep decrease in production was in large part due to wades overall health but its certainly at the foundation for wade needing to put up impressive numbers this season recently wade has struggled to stay healthy hes taken a back seat to lebron and hes even starting to take shots from other nba superstars insert the shot heard round the world from kevin durant mark d smithusa today sports durants opinion is certainly valid and yet a little absurd because of just how dominant wade has been over the past decade needless to say wade has a lot on the line this season the first thing being the player year option that is coming up in lebrons contract with the heat steve mitchellusa today sports lebrons looming player option year of his contractthis may seem nonsensical since dwyane wade is dwyane wade but hes reaching the point of his career where retaining elite talent around him is critical to his success every nba fan knows that lebron can decide to take his talents anywhere he wants to next year or even open up another year of recruitment by opting out of his contract with the heat wade must show his value to lebron thereby enticing him to not opt out of his contract because honestly there are a few places lebron could go to find more youthful talentyep cleveland and kyrie irving were looking at you steve mitchellusa today sports with his production and play this year wade needs to show lebron that he would be a fool to leave miami and the chemistry theyve developed it will be a tough task for wade but its certainly a major motivator for him this season every game that wade plays should be another reason for lebron to stay in south beach dont believe me just watch http t co 4drl3yevw0 three dwyanewade september 2013making kevin durant and any other doubters eat their wordsthe last thing durant needed to do this offseason was spark a fire under wade when durant basically told wade to step aside and let james harden have his spot in the top players in the league he gave wade another reason to make this year the best of his career gary a vasquezusa today sports its not okay for wade to just play decently and win another title behind lebrons continued dominance he needs to not only push everyone around him to be better but he needs to compete with lebron for the top spot on the team what better way to shut durant and any other critic up than to vie for not only the top spot on the heat but also the top spot in the entire league show me dont tweet me kevin durant kdtrey5 september 2013yes i think its totally feasible for wade to be so efficient and productive that the heat have two mvp candidates by the time this season comes to an end if wade is truly as healthy as all of the reports have indicated then there is no reason for wade to take a step back in production again this season what better way to show durant wrong than to beat him out in mvp voting at the end of the year or maybe even beat him out for a shot at the scoring titleokay thats a bit far but you see where im going derick e hingleusa today sport wades talents arent getting any cheaperwade isnt technically in a contract year because although next season is a player option year hes the one calling the shots on if hell stay in miami or not even if wade puts up points rebounds and assists per game its hard to imagine wade opting out of his contract that has him earning million to play in the place hes called home for the past years will wade have the best year of his career this season yesnosubmit votevote to see resultswill wade have the best year of his career this season yes61 no38 total votes if br polldata br polldata if br polldata br polldata id question will wade have the best year of his career this season choices choice0 count choice yes choice6 count choice choice1 count choice no choice7 count choice choice2 count choice choice8 count choice choice3 count choice choice9 count choice choice4 count choice choice5 count choice sidebar false if br poll br poll showresults false

4 the miami heats preseason has gone terrifically to this point and thats not just because they are two guys whom miami probably needs on its final 15man roster michael beasley and roger mason jr have played well james jones who may be asked to fill mike millers role has been lightsout from outside norris cole has continued his hot shooting from the playoffs chris bosh has dominated offensively the list of players performing to a satisfactory level goes on and on still no team is perfect there remain a couple of miami players whose preseasons havent gone as well as hoped lets take an indepth look at those players struggles mario chalmerswere dealing with an extremely small sample size given that the heat have played just three games that sample size is even smaller for chalmers because he sat out the heats second contest hes only taken five threepoint shots but rio has come up empty on each of them miami was dominant from downtown in the season percent from three and chalmers was a big part of that 3pt hopefully for the teams sake this is just a tiny cold streak issac baldizon getty images mario hasnt had any luck from outside in the preseason but chalmers preseason problems dont just come from beyond the arc he also turned the ball over five times in the heats preseason opener mario really cut down on his turnovers per game in after topg in and the boneheaded mental mistakes last season rio became someone the heat could legitimately count on in it would be a shame for miami if he started reverting back to his old ways again were dealing with the tiniest of sample sizes here but rio just hasnt had it going through two games ray allen issac baldizon getty images allen hasnt has success from outside despite having some really nice looks preseason success shouldnt mean much to a 17year veteran like allen when the regular season gets going allen is likely to do what hes done throughout his hall of fame career convert percent of his threepoint attempts still that doesnt mean ray hasntunderperformed thispreseason his shots just havent been falling hes shooting percent from the field and percent on his threepointers in the heats most recent game allen hit just 1of7 shots failing to take advantage of some really good looks ray allen having a night of pointblank misses at the rim smiling though its just preseason after all not game of the finals ira winderman iraheatbeat october 2013allens value to miami stems almost solely from his shooting so while he doesnt appear concerned with his misfortune from the threepoint line it would be nice for the heat if ray could see the ball go through the net some more before the heats season opener on oct

4 off the court the main focus for the new york knicks right now is keeping carmelo anthony in town for as long as possible melo is entering only his third full season in new york but most expect him to opt out of his contract at the end of the year in order to sign a new bigger deal until he puts pen to paper theres still a small threat that anthony could choose to leave if he opts out of his contract theres been talk of a potential move to the los angeles lakers but that seems unlikely this is his hometown team he grew up in brooklyn until the age of eight and considering all the effort it took for him to get hereand that they can offer him more moneyits hard to picture him leaving so soon anthony has said as much himself according to newsday new york is where he wants to be im not going nowhere that is one of the reasons why i wanted to come here to new york just so i could take on those pressures and those challenges a lot of people do not like to deal with the pressure a lot of people do not know how to deal with the challenges they face to me it is everyday life the question is more about if the knicks want to spend the money on anthony theyll have almost every contract coming off the books in but signing anthony to a max fiveyear million deal in would take out a large chunk of the cap space theyd be creating usa today sports the dream scenario would be to pair melo with lebron but either way the former needs to be resigned with that said it seems pretty clear right now that anthonty is the man to build around coming off a career year the knicks arent going to find anyone better in free agency to take his place like anthony lebron james has an optout clause at the end of the season but he seems pretty content in miami and if he were to consider the knicks hed likely be partnering up with anthony rather than replacing him in other words the first step of that process would be to bring back anthony beyond a potential melolebron partnership there really is no better option for new york and when the time comes to start negotiating the knicks front office should have no qualms about bringing back anthony for another six years if the knicks can get a deal done as soon as possible with their star forward the future looks bright for the franchise in addition to anthony new york will have only j r smith raymond felton pablo prigioni and tim hardaway jr under contract in the summer of leaving them with plenty of cap space with which to work assuming anthony takes up around million in salary the knicks payroll will sit at only million including the unguaranteed contracts of prigioni and hardaway iman shumpert will be a restricted free agent with a qualifying offer of million in but if he continues to progress the knicks could end up needing a lot more to keep him in town for the sake of this article lets mark his salary down as million in total that leaves the knicks payroll at million which is well under the salary cap of million based on this years cap figure usa today sports lamarcus aldridge and marc gasol are two players the knicks could go after in while filling a roster with million isnt easy the knicks have been able to do a lot with virtually no cap flexibility over the past three years therefore the front office has to be licking its lips at the prospect of retooling the roster with that kind of cap space looking at the freeagent crop in the knicks could use a large portion of that money to bring in a second star for anthony with rajon rondo kevin love lamarcus aldridge and marc gasol all hitting the open market shumpert will likely be the starter at shooting guard leaving the knicks to use either hardaway or smith as a trade chip to bring in a new starter to complement anthony its way too early to think about the specifics of how new york will approach free agency in but this way theyll have the core of their roster assembledwith it being anthony shumpert a major free agent and whomever they receive in a trade for hardaway or smith after that it will come down to filling the roster with the midlevel exception the biannual exception and veterans minimum contracts theyll also have bird rights for the likes of tyson chandler amare stoudemire and andrea bargnani making it easier to bring them back likely on smaller deals even if they go over the salary cap jesse d garrabrant getty images stoudemire and chandler both come off the books in but bringing them back on more reasonable deals would be a good way to add depth it wont be a oneyear process but despite anthonys hefty salary retooling shouldnt be too difficult for a bigmarket franchise with plenty of cap space all it will require is smart spending the knicks cant afford another stoudemiretype situation weighing down their books again it must be stressed just how early this is but realistically the knicks rotation could look something like this by the end of the offseason pgfree agent up to million feltonsgshumpert hardawaysfanthony free agent biannual exception million pffree agent midlevel exception million bargnanictrade acquisition for smith chandlerdepending on who exactly fills in the blank roster spots this could be a titlecontending team in two years but if not another midlevel acquisition the next year might be all it takes the important thing to understand is thatbecause of james dolans willingness to go over the luxurytax thresholdthe knicks have been able to build a deep team despite having million going towards stoudemire once comes around theyll be able to start again with that money going to a legit second option ideally a player without such a worrying injury history from that point onwards it will be another case of using every cap exception possible to build the rest of the team essentially resigning anthony is a nobrainer its a lot of money to spend on one player but thats what you do when you find someone worth building around if appropriate personnel decisions are made therell still be more than enough cap space for the knicks front office to put together an elite team as long as they leave enough money for that allimportant second star the knicks should do everything in their power to keep anthony in new york theyve already started that process with the hiring of steve mills and the extending of mike woodsons contract and it should continue with a max contract for melo next summer
4 miami his nickname is beasy his twitter handle is easyst0 theres nothing easy though about michael beasleys situation with the miami heat theres nothing easy about asking for another chance from the same people who provided the initial opportunity you squandered theres nothing easy about trying to fit in with a returning champion and to do so on a contract with no guarantee theres nothing easy about acknowledging mistakes over and over theres nothing easy about doing this in public with the media so eager to recalland constantly demanding you reliveyour previous failings so say this much for beasley through the first two weeks of his second goround with miami hes handling all these hard parts surprisingly well so far showing a vulnerability and maturity that appears authentic my first time around i was a knucklehead beasley acknowledged after sundays practice just that guy coming from nothing into a lot of money that just thought he knew everything this time around im just going to try to be more part of the team and more part of the community and more part of miami heat culture and it takes effort that was evident saturday night after a road trip in which he efficiently scored points in minutes over two games as he was the only other heat player to appear at dwyane wades gq hennessy event on south beach wade arrived fashionably late and when he did they hugged and posed for photos together just like old times when they were the teams primary scorers only now wade has won two more championships and beasley is returning after falling out of favor with two other organizations issac baldizon getty images it takes me taking an extra step doing things like i did last night charity events i plan to do a toy drive or i know udonis haslem does a toy drive so i plan to help him with that toy drive beasley said just being more a part of the culture and being more handson even if his hands sometimes shake beasley has said repeatedly and did again sunday that he was edgy about reentering the heat environment i kind of came in with an eerie feeling kind of scared and nervous as to how they were going to accept me beasley said but everybody from dwade to ud to mario chalmers to joel anthony and even lebron james everybodys just taken me in as their little brother it just feels good to be wanted to actually be somewhere where they want to have you and that he says has extended outside the facility im actually scared to go in public sometimes because of that same eerie feeling i had coming into the locker room beasley said you dont know but walking around downtown and just going to the event last night everybody loves me all i get is welcome back happy to have you lets get a threepeat just to have that type of love walking around the city outside of the arena its the cherries on top thats actually an apt description of his potential role on this roster hes a potential sweetener to an already tasty mix beasley stated sunday that hes ready for more opportunities than hes gotten so far still he has shown the necessary recognition of the circumstances that hes not likely to be a goto scorer with this group that he needs to focus on the socalled effort areas everything ive done on offense the past two games has honestly been an accident beasley said im just trying to play hard on defense trying to rebound the ball a little better than i have been heres the reality if he does those things at merely an adequate level hes a serious threat to crack a stacked rotation thats because he can do something that no one else other than norris cole on occasion can he can create a shot with his dribble that ability could make erik spoelstra feel a bit more comfortable resting two of the big three more often with the remaining one working with beasley to generate offense wade even while still labeling beasley a raw talent acknowledged that beasleys proven skill at getting his shot for himself has the chance to become another dynamic that we didnt have the past couple of years on the second unit and could beasley work his way into a bigger role later on im not that smart to look that far beasley said smiling im just trying to take it day by day hes doing so with a smile resisting reporters repeated attempts to get him to bash the minnesota timberwolves or phoenix sunsand turning the conversation back to the present he said heat culture means everything to me what is that robert mayerusa today sports its the way they live the way they play beasley noted its just doing things the right way doing them in good faith and doing them all hard the critics will say that beasley didnt do enough of those things during his first exposure to heat culture theyll say theres no reason to believe hell conform this time especially if the minutes are so scarce that he believes hes receiving little reward for his compliance they may be right but theres also plenty of examples of players who had some trouble elsewhere from anthony mason to rod strickland to lamar odom who responded well to the heats structure its a mindset i guess shane battier explained when you come to work you are expected to work you are expected to focus and concentrate that sounds like a basic tenet for an nba player but thats not always the case every team has its own culture but the heat have sort of branded it and they talk about and extol its virtues so its a more tangible thing than other places and longtime heat coaches and officials will tell you the organization has never had a more professional core of players i always think that the strongest force on a team is peer pressure battier said no one wants to be the outlier and look like an idiot and if you come here and you act like an idiot youre really on the outside it goes back to culture guys want to fit in and when you see everyone come to work be professional do their jobs play hard have a good time you buy in thats the strength of this group is it strong enough to help reform a selfproclaimed knucklehead turns out it might not be as hard as we thought ethan skolnick covers the miami heat for bleacher report

4 the detroit pistons have been interested in rajon rondo for a while since kevin garnett and paul pierce were shipped off to brooklyn most teams have been but what makes detroit different is it might have a player whom boston would actually want in return for its franchise point guard that player is emerging big man andre drummond who was described by the boston globes gary washburnin july when the rondotodetroit rumors were swirling as asclose to untouchable as a younger player can get why is he such a prized possession for the pistons well 270pound players with wingspans and 34inch vertical leaps dont grow on treesat least not in detroit and those physical tools helped drummond to be effective despite his epic struggles at the freethrow line per minutes he averaged points rebounds and blocks and posted a player efficiency rating of which is impressive since he shot percent from the freethrow line but even with such enticing numbers who knows how long drummond will remain untouchable situations and storylines change all the time in the nba and weve all seen deals go down that never seemed possible kwame brown for pau gasol anyone allen einstein getty images detroit made a splash this summer by adding josh smith and brandon jennings detroits situation could be as fluid as any in the league the pistons have been bad for a few years now so they loaded up on talent in the form of josh smith and brandon jennings this summer and based on that talent alone you have to think theyll improve but raw talent doesnt always equate to success ill go ahead and point to the los angeleslakers again the pieces dont seem to fit in detroit at least if the histories of all these players are any guide lets start with the new guys jennings and smithwho both need to bid some of their midrange jump shots adieu jennings wasnt awful but he wasnt great eitherchucking up attempts in the range between feet and the threepoint line and connecting on percent on the other hand smithwashorrible from there hitting percent of a whopping attempts and to compound his problem he took threes and hit just percent honestly would anyone be surprised to see these two openly fighting each other for the ball if theyre both in that range on the bright side the pistons new chuckers will create a lot of offensive rebounding opportunities for drummond and greg monroe but there again we may have another fight on our hands those two players work best in the paint in fact theyonlywork in the paint and thats where smith should be as well take a look at these basketballreference heat maps for monroe drummond and smith and tell me the pistons wont need a plumber to unclog the lane from left to right these are the heat maps of andre drummond greg monroe and josh smith all three need to be at the rim to be effective suffice it to say these pistons might not fit in or fire on all cylinders and considering how bad detroit has been for a few years if things dont start to turn around this year general manager joe dumars might find himself on the hot seat if it gets warm enough he may pull the trigger on a deal that could unclog the lane and balance the roster a bit and there might not be a better option than rondowhom detroit once coveted i always run trade ideas through espns nba trade machine to make sure they work under the rules of the current collective bargaining agreement and to land rondo on the pistons i had to turn one of detroits expiring contracts over to boston since rondo is a guard i went with rodney stuckey as an expiring contract paired with drummond the deal it would principally be rondo for drummond and stuckey there could also be some draft considerations or smallcontract players either way why it works for boston raj mehtausa today sports can andre drummond be the next great celtics big man theyre rebuilding and hanging onto rondo just slows that down a bit does theceltics brass really think they can make the playoffs this year and do they really think rondo will resign after next season to play for a team on the brink of playoff contention the celtics are better off saving some money now stuckeys deal is off the books this summer while rondos isnt until and bottoming out in the hopes of landing a topthree or four pick in the draft it would be a pick they could add to a potentially nightmarish insideout frontcourt of drummond and kelly olynyk why it works for detroitright now the pistons have a lot of guys who love to score but no one to set them up jennings has the capacity to do it and maybe he will but history is not on the side of that argument rondo is a master of creating shots for others he may be the best in the nba hes led the league in assists per game for the last two seasons and is fifth all time in assist percentage the amount of dunks he would get smith and monroe would keep both happy and he could spend some time on the floor with jennings as well giving the shootingguardatheart a chance to fire a few more open shots than hes used to losing drummond would hurt but gaining arguably the best pure point guard in the nba might be worth it a bigifwould rajon rondo be worth andre drummond

4 milwaukee wibuzz williams got the marquette season underway on a critical note in his media day press conference williams explained that his teamwhich was standing on the other half of the court preparing to take its team photohad a terrible month of september because of its lack of leadership it was quite a way to kick off the season for a team that had just reached the elite eight for the first time in a decade but would you expect anything else from buzz despite their coachs doubts a lot of players feel they have the leadership in place i feel like ive consistently proved that im a leader said senior forward jamil wilson i feel like weve got a pretty good leadership group center chris otule labeled the leaders as jamil and derrick wilson but he knows that he needs to step up his leadership skills as well thats something i have to improve on otule said this year the guys are like and years old and im so i have to take on more of that talkative role the big man said he was allowed to return for his sixth year because of his clean record it really had to do with my history at marquette otule said i never got in trouble and was never a negative person that allowed me to get a sixth year otule said he decided to come back because he wanted to play two consecutive seasons something he had never done during his injuryplagued career going into this year otule said his body feels as good as it ever has definitely the best my bodys felt no brace no sleeve or nothing im running better and just feel better one big issue marquette generates on the floor is its plethora of big men although otule and his fellow center davante gardner didnt spend much time on the court together last season otule thinks the pairing could provide a large advantage on the hardwood hopefully we could play a little bit more together this year otule said i believe when we play at the same time we do well together steve taylor said that the amount of versatile forwards on this team could be a matchup disaster for opponents i think everybody on our team is a mismatch taylor said i think its gonna be hard for teams to guard us because our bigs are not really bigs theyre like guards they can play on the post and on the perimeter i think its gonna be hard for teams to guard us oneonone unlike otule taylor did suffer a knee injury during the offseason but he said his knee was getting better and he was close to percent its evident that williams has plenty of forwards to shuffle around but the issue was who would replace juniorcadougan at point guard for the golden eagles derrick wilson seems like hes ready to take on the task of driving the offense wilson said he had a strong offseason and worked on improving his offensive skills he said even williams was starting to believe in his jumper buzz is actually starting to believe in it his shot wilson said its good to hear from timetotime one thing that makes wilson a luxury at point guard is his ability to take care of the basketball williams raved about wilsons prudence on the floor during his press conference but wilson knows he needs to break out of his cautious mold if he wants to lead the offense i hate turning over the ball its a waste of a possession wilson said i think thats also hurt me because sometimes you have to take chances to make certain plays another thing that makes wilson unique is his experience as a twosport athlete at the hotchkiss school in anchorage alaska i played running back and linebacker in high school and you have to read things wilson said the way peoples hips move the way the line moves i think that has helped me defensively staying in front of people and making a guess of where theyre going the other player who could see some minutes at the point is duane wilson a freshman from dominican high school in milwaukee wilson may be the more talented scorer but he is prepared to thrive in any opportunity he gets to play my first goal is just to be on a team that hopefully wins a national championship the younger wilson said second be a great team player and then fill any role that buzz throws at me these are encouraging words to hear from a freshman especially one as talented as wilson he deonte burton and jajuan johnson are three special recruits who could see some considerable minutes in their freshman seasons one of the main themes of the offseason was coming going and returning jamal ferguson jake thomas and juan anderson all had plans to transfer in march ferguson ultimately did transfer but anderson and thomas decided to return to marquette weeks after choosing to depart andersons decision was the most shocking because it was sudden and unexplainable anderson said that once he came home in may he had to weigh the positives and negatives of transferring i received my release as everyone knows i went home talked to my mom compared pros and cons and we decided it was best that i come back anderson said one question anderson faced throughout media day was why he decided to leave marquette in the first place he said it was a combination of multiple factors but mainly because of his desire to be at home with his family im real close with my family and i was getting home sick a little bit anderson said i have a little brother and sister so im missing them growing up anderson explained there were no negative feelings when he did get his release and that everyone brought him back with open arms when he decided to return most importantly anderson said he is relieved for this process to be over im happy with my decision im glad were doing media day so all these questions will get out of the way anderson said i was expecting the questions so im glad were moving forward this marquette team has been the popular pick to win the reformed big east but the teams expectations are still high regardless of the praise it has received to win thats about it jamil wilson said i know we added a couple of schools and things like that but i dont think that changes our goal we try to win each and every day and try not to give too much time away my goal is to get farther than we did last year taylor said even if we dont get as far as we did last year i expect us to play as hard as we can each and every night to continue the success that they had in the original big east and to come out compete and play hard said junior college transfer jameel mckay to win each game at a time dylan flood said we see we are one of the people picked to win the big east but we cant get caught up in that we gotta realize that every game is going to be a challenge and just go into every game and do the best we can to win i dont know how much were gonna win but i do know were gonna win a lot of games anderson said we have a great team a wellrounded team great leaders and a great coach
4 tonight two of the eastern conferences most intriguing teams will face off in rio de janeiro as the bulls and wizards will continue their preseason schedules with a game in brazil for varying reasons both teams are expecting to be much better than they were a year ago chicago is once again taking to the floor with former mvp derrick rose in the fold and the wizards are hoping that their promising young core continues to develop both teams have a handful of unproven talent on their rosters so heading into this exhibition clash heres a look at the top young guns to watch out for in rio bradley bealthe no overall pick of the nba draft bradley beal entered the league as one of the games most promising young prospects and as a rookie he certainly didnt disappoint ned dishman getty images health was a persistent issue with the former florida gators sharpshooter but overall beal demonstrated all the abilities that made him one of the hottest players in college basketball two years ago an allrookie first team selection last season beals points per game and mark from behind the arc were impressive but hes capable of much more especially once he and john wall have time to develop more chemistry beals got to get into a rhythm during the preseason because the wizards ability to sneak up on the rest of the conference and grab a postseason berth will depend on wall beal and no pick otto porter and whether they can coexist effectively marquis teagueafter a solid freshman season as part of the national champion kentucky wildcats the bulls took marquis teague with the 29th pick in the draft that year one season into his nba career it looks as if teague may have wanted to stay at kentucky for another year or two after starting all games for john caliparis team he saw just over eight minutes a night for the bulls in issac baldizon getty images but hes still got the potential to be an impact player at the nba level and his strong showing during summer league play was encouraging its far too early to give up on the 20yearold guard that being said he probably wont see the floor much more this season especially with rose back in the fold but that may be the best thing for his development in the long run tony snellas the bulls firstrounder this year tony snell is undoubtedly a prized asset in chicago but as was the case with teague last season the teams impressive amount of depth will likely mean that the rangy shooting guard doesnt see much of the floor in garrett ellwood getty images and as stated above thats probably not a bad thing for the former new mexico standout because in order for him to be effective at the next level hes got to work on honing his shot and diversifying his offensive game after averaging more than points and six boards a game during summer league play snells clearly got the potential to be a twoway threat in the nba so these preseason games will be early auditions for him to show what hes capable of

4 while veteran leaders jarrett jack and carl landry are certainly going to be hard for the golden state warriors to replace neither marks the teams biggest loss of the offseason that would be michael malone one of the best assistant coaches in the nba and the man behind golden states defensive turnaround over the past two seasons despite an improved starting lineup deeper bench apparent health and playoff experience the warriors will not improve in if malones shoes are not adequately filled new to golden states bench are assistant coaches brian scalabrine and lindsey hunter gone are malone and bob beyer the former is now the head coach for the sacramento kings while the latter has joined the charlotte bobcats bench replacing malone will not be easy the same cannot be said about beyer malones impact kyle teradausa today sports before looking at what scalabrine and hunter can bring to the warriors sideline it is first important to know what the team is missing without malone malones defensive credentials go back further than his time in oakland he was instrumental in turning lebron james cleveland cavaliers into a defensive powerhouse from in he turned the new orleans hornets defense into the mostimproved unit in the league malone is known as one of the great defensive strategists in the nba but his offensive xs and os are also well above average some reporters even believe malone was percent responsible for the warriors offensive sets over the past two seasons and that the warriors are in danger of a big strategic drop off on both ends without him while that seems dramatic the recently promoted lead assistant coach pete myers is fully capable of calling plays the warriors will miss malones discipline and defensive expertise brian scalabrinea common response to those who questioned the hiring of mark jackson straight out of the broadcast booth to a headcoaching gig was that he has played in more nba games than all but human beings ever have hes fourth on the alltime list among point guards which is considered the best coachbreeding position a very different argument can be made for scalabrines credentials although i could not find a statistic on this it is likely that the former big man hes still big is among the nbas alltime leaders in minutes spent on the bench this theory is based on the fact that scalabrine spent years in the nba but averaged only minutes a game so while jacksons oncourt leadership and playcalling experience may help him work the sidelines scalabrines experience of watching nba games from up close may in fact translate more directly to the sidelines since retiring in scalabrine had been working as a boston celticscommentator having only been out of the league for a year he should bring a deep knowledge of opposing players and what it is like to play against themat least more so than most assistant coaches in the league his relative youthalong with a funloving persona and famous sense of humorshould also make him an excellent players coach and a bridge between the rest of the staff and the team whether he has any credence as a playcaller remains up in the air but it stands to reason that the rest of the staff outranks him in that area lindsey hunter usa today sports jackson left and hunter right will be sharing a sideline more often this season the 42yearold hunter falls right in between scalabrine and jackson in terms of age scalabrine is jackson is and nba experience games for hunter for scalabrine and for jackson he also ranks in the middle of that trio coachingexperience wise unlike the other two hunter skipped the broadcast booth and immediately became a player development assistant with the chicago bulls following retirement he joined the phoenix suns staff last summer and replaced alvin gentry as the head coach halfway through the season while hunters time in phoenix did not go well by headcoaching standards he couldnt have been expected to do any better considering his lack of experience and sudden insertion midseason not to mention his terrible roster and its questionable personalities now hunter comes to oakland as a highly qualified assistant it is always a plus to have multiple coaches on the roster with headcoaching experience and hunters background in player development will be crucial to this stillyoung roster filling malones shoes kyle teradausa today sports hunter and scalabrine will help but it is likely to be jackson left and myers right who take over malones role as the teams lead play caller scalabrine was a great add to the staff for multiple reasonsknowledge of the league personality and ally for playersbut hunter will go much further toward replacing malone hunter was known as a very good defensive point guard during his 17year nba career and has already assisted in the development of quality young defenders in chicago and phoenix also to that end malones role as the warriors main player development coach will be completely filled by hunter holes still remain due to malones departure that hunter and scalabrine are unlikely to fill neither has ever designed nor called plays fortunately myers assistant darren erman and jackson worked closely with malone and should be able to adequately assume the role myers is likely to take the lead the team is still likely to suffer a slight step backwards with their coaching staff overall but the additions of scalabrine and hunter will go a long way toward maintaining this groups position among the upper third of staffs in the league all stats courtesy of

4 theres nothing wrong with nba superstars looking out for their own interests theres nothing wrong with the very best in basketball seeking out greener pastures bigger bank accounts and more enriching opportunities in new and different cities any given pros playing career will only last as long as his mortal coil allows it to as such he might as well make the most of his time on the court whether that means chasing greenbacks contending for championships or both theres nothing inherently wrong with showboating or selfish play either in many cases these characteristics are mere outgrowths of the unusually competitive spirit that drives the worlds most accomplished athletes toward greatness celebrations are the spoils of success while a player taking over the game is more often the reflection of a burning desire to win and a supreme belief in ones ability to do so than it is a reflection of purely pompous egotism not that there isnt plenty to be said for sportsmanship humility unselfishness and the like look no further than kevin durant whos thrived among the leagues elite for several years now while cultivating a public persona that runs counter to those of the boldest and brashest of his predecessors that persona works beautifully as a blueprint to be followed by the young talents coming up behind durant in the nbas neverending cycle of stardom joe murphy getty images derek fisher durants current teammate with the oklahoma city thunder recently served as a reminder of kds seemingly unique standing within the association when asked about the similarities between durant and kobe bryant with whom fisher won five titles as a member of the los angeles lakers the 39yearold point guard toldben jefferson ofthe daily express bold added the qualities that make the great players like kobe who they are is just that theyre relentless in their preparation theyre relentless in their desire to be better than everyone else i think kevin has come back as a better player every single year from what ive seen so far i think hes better now than he was last season what continues to separate kevin from so many other young guys before him and probably those that will come after him is that hes a phenomenal person he really cares about the success of others around him and i think that is what will always make the conversation about how great he was once hes done very fun to have because whatever success he has his teammates will have it with him and thats what hes always wanted in this context fishers comments could be interpreted as derisive toward his former championship chum by showering durant with praise for being a caring communal person hes implicitly suggesting that bryantisntthose things right depends on how determined you are to make mountains out of nonexistent molehills i suppose but to focus too much on whats left unsaid about the black mamba here is to ignore the bigger pattern developing on durants part at the tender age of durant is already a master of something that most famous athletes and celebrities never quite grasp compartmentalization mark d smithusa today sports over the past few seasons durant has slowly but surely developed a much edgier nastier persona on the courthe tied for eighth in the league with technicals last seasonall the while maintaining his personable goodnatured self off it as thunder big man kendrick perkins described it to benjamin hochman ofthe denver post this past march you have the one kevin durant who will sign everyones autograph take a picture never turn down a fan but then when he gets on the court hes having fun but at the same time he loves to win and hetakes losing personally thats when you see that fire come out oftentimes that very fire spills over into an athletes dealings with the mediaand rightfully so people like kd are in many cases required to answer questions that can be blunt and uncomfortable as they should be i might add immediately before and or after spending twoandahalf hours pouring their heart and soul into the very task about which theyre being asked durant to his credit has thus far done an excellent job of handling himself amidst the persistent sea of blinding lights clunky cameras and outstretched arms dangling recording devices in the pro basketball writers association gave durant the magic johnson award which recognizes productive players who cooperate with and accommodate the myriad demands of the basketball media this after a summer in which kd hung back while some of his slightly older peers spent much of their time soaking up the perks of free agency before lebron james revealed his controversial decision during a primetime special on espn durant beat him to the punch with a simple tweet announcing his max contract extension exstension for more years wit the thunder god is great me and my family came a long way i love yall man forreal this a blessing kevin durant kdtrey5 july 2010no flashing lights no rabid fanfare no posturing over the possibility of playing in a bigger market just characters of distilled sentiment the thing is that fell in with durants reputation even at hes long spoken highly and frequently of the importance of family with hugs and kisses for his mother wanda pratt after every game okc plays when asked about being beaten to the title punch by his fiancee monica wright of the wnba champion minnesota lynx kd suggested that shes the better baller between them pdgraham30 i love it shes the better player anyway kevin durant kdtrey5 october 2013a smart man indeed doing everything to support his future spouse up to and including downplaying his own greatness to allow her to shine durant is widely considered the secondbest basketball player on earth with three scoring crowns and a season under his belt yet hes willing to throw all of that under the bus for his significant other this doesnt necessarily make durant an otherworldly amazing guy but it does make him human in a way thats relatable for his adoring public his apparent disposition is rare for someone of his fame fortune and youth so too is his understanding of how to obtain the former two and where the latter leaves him he seems to understand better than most that you dont need to live and play in a major media market to become a global icon sure it helped guys like michael jordan and kobe bryant to call cities like chicago and l a home but whats truly driven the expansion of their respective international brands are their reputations as winners at the highest level of a sport whose popularity defies borders lebron james is in the midst of a similar ascendancy in the earthlyzeitgeist thanksto his tremendous exploits with the miami heat james was maligned for leaving behind the cleveland cavaliers for a life on south beach though itd be tough to argue that he did so purely for marketing purposes according to a number of notable indices cleveland and miami are neckandneck in terms of their footprints as media markets usa today sports the point being the ubiquity of mass media in the modern day has made it easier than ever for megastars to develop their brands from anywhere what matters much more than location is the quality of the product being put forth and the comfort that said megastar enjoys wherever he or she happens to be in durants case he seems content to stay in a relatively small sports town like oklahoma city because hes comfortable with his surroundings including the organization of which he is such a vital part he showed his support for the sooner state in a big way this past may when he donated million of his own money to tornado relief and convinced countless others to contribute to the cause as he told darnell mayberry ofthe oklahoman after reupping with the thunder in im a very loyal person people say that might hurt me sometimes but i think its a great attribute that i have by them offering me the max it shows me that theyre loyal to me as well so i was ready just ready to sign right then and there opt out or not and start moving forward were building something great here and i didnt want anything to jeopardize that im happy im a part of this organization and hopefully everybody sticks together this isnt to suggest that those players who cant or dont find the same level of comfort in one place or another are somehow inferior for that reason lebron had every right to leave cleveland after giving the cavs seven years to build a legitimate champion around him the optics may not have played out in his favor but the reasons underlying his move were sound nor is any of this intended as some backhanded swipe at the stereotyped ghosts of jocks past present and future individuality and attitude are among the many hallmarks of american life that are well worth celebrating those youngsters touted as the next big thing shouldnt follow in durants footsteps because he doesnt have visible tattoos or because his public persona is so perfectly manicured kd has tons of body art thats covered up by his jersey and was fined last season for this menacing gesture against the golden state warriors hes no angel nor is he trying to be if anything durants handlers probably prefer that kd not be so nice rather if kevin durant is going to be held up as a role model for the nbas next generation it should be for his impeccable work ethic his dogged determination to improve year after year and his wisebeyondhisyears ability to cultivate multiple personalities in a manner that both boosts his q rating and doesnt divide his psyche to a troubling degree and if kd comes away with a championship and or an mvp at seasons end there will be all the more reason to think of durant as a great ballplayer who also happens to be an exceptional human being what do you think of kd let me know on twitter follow joshmartinnba
4 kobe bryant is more likely to demand a trade to the houston rockets than the los angeles lakers are to tank anywhere else tanking might be justifiable the philadelphia 76ers havent been shy about their aversion to winning despite what general manager danny ainge says the boston celtics are right there as well so tanking does happen and it can go down in larger marketsexcept in los angeles for a certain team sporting purple and gold as long as the fiercely sometimes irrationally competitive black mamba is both still playing and has a say in the daytoday operations the lakers arent going to tank it would be a public relations disaster not merely because theyre one of the most famed franchises in all of sports either though their standing is reason enough to avoid it kobes reaction is the icing on an alreadyfrosted cake yet what if he didnt have a choice what if the lakers themselves had no choice or what if something so compelling went down that he and the lakers agreed to the unthinkable and tanked this season out of kobes handskobes shattered timetable gone wrong andrew d bernstein getty images if kobe is to miss opening night against the los angeles clippers like thelos angeles times mike bresnahan says he will the clock starts ticking probably no lakers opener for kobe who says hell need at least weeks of hard conditioning to get in shape hasnt started that yet mike bresnahan mike bresnahan october 2013all this talk of shattered timetables and kobe being ahead of schedulesuggests hell be back sooner rather than later regardless of whether sooner means opening night or not should something go terribly wrongan unexpected setback united states residents are forever banned from germany kobe reinjures himself upon return or while trying to save the world frompinky and the brainthe lakers will find themselves up tankers creek without a kobeshaped paddle at which point theyll be free to start nick young at center institute a seconds or more policy on offense see what i did there did you see what iokay ill go home now or ask that steve nash and pau gasol play every possession with their eyes closed the likelihood of this happening seems about a zillion to one but thats why they call this the unthinkable in some ways though this becomes realistic if something horrible happens to kobe during his recovery or initial return which it could hes not anymore hes years north of that bodies wear down and father time plays pranks only he finds funny wasting an entire season will be difficult no matter what gasol and nashthe oldest player in the nbaare only getting older and arent likely to embrace losing but if kobe isnt there to lead an improbable cause the lakers seriously arent going anywhere as someone whos much higher on the lakers than most i really mean that without him they might as well you know what john michael higgins says everybody get everybody getinjured andrew d bernstein getty images kobe isnt the only laker injured or old mike dantoni has already said that steve nash currently battling an injured ankle will sit on and off this season according to dave mcmenamin of espn los angeles and whats the one thing worse than kobe missing most or all of this season nash and kobe missing extended time together worse than that nash kobe and gasol missing extended time together gasol appeared in a careerlow games last season while fighting a losing battle with plantar fasciitis those injuries have a nasty tendency to linger see joakim noah and tyreke evans him rejoining injured ranks that already include kobe and or nash all but seals the lakers fate in a can of baked losing really at that point it isnt tanking its just the lakers playing like the lakers removing more than one of gasol kobe and nash would cripple any hope los angeles has at winning games let alone staying above and making the playoffs the lakers could be outmatched as it is in a terrifyingly strong western conference mounting injuries only put them at a further disadvantage were this to occur were los angeles geriatric three to act their age and fold to the rigors of an 82game season the lakers would have no choice but to tank while also holding open tryouts at a local y slightly outrageous albeit kobe approveddavid stern vetoes nba teams right to tank stacy revere getty images david stern once vetoed kobes right to play alongside chris paul much to the mambas displeasure at the nba allstar game kobe found a way around sterns ironfisted rule teaming up with cp3s offspring little chris and rubbing it in the commissioners face

institutes a notanking policy before he retires the lakers and kobe will have found a common enemy maybe just maybe kobe would then be willing to tank just to give mr stern the ol what for hoodwinking the mamba cameron browne getty images imagine kobe came back to a team decimated by injuries picture gasol and or nash going down while kobe remains healthy what are the lakers and kobe to do tank or as mitch kupchak and mike dantoni will tell kobe it is called operation shoot kobe shoot noah graham getty images if nash and pau go down the lakers can tank without ever telling kobe unlike the western conference is no longer structured in a way that kobe can carry the lakers to the playoffs on his own i wont even touch upon his age though that is a factor the balance of power is too skewed toward super teams for one star to do everything on his own as it stands the san antonio spurs oklahoma city thunder golden state warriors memphis grizzlies houston rockets and clippers are the clear

defiance 12th kobe bryant kobebryant october 2013unable to play next to nash and gasol kobe will be given explicit instructions let er rip it will be like when he jacked up shots a night only this

butler getty images we already know the lakerskobes next contract willingplan to chase carmelo anthony and lebron james next summer presumably los angeles would take any edge it could get in said pursuit normally tanking wouldnt yield it when lebron and chris bosh joined dwyane wade in south beach the miami heat had at least made the playoffs the season before neither melo nor lebron both of whom will be closing in on will be keen on joining a tankster right maybe maybe not joining forces on a losing faction when the core of the team comprises a 35goingon36yearold kobe and 40yearold steve nash probably wouldnt sit well with the king or his volumeshooting companion but it would sit a whole lot better if the lakers were to say win the lottery and the right to draft andrew wiggins any topfive pick could do the trick the upcoming draft is rife with star potential kind of like los angeles becomes a whole lot more appealing to lebron and melo if its roster has kobe nash and a topfive

4 you hear chemistry thrown out there as a barrier some question the brooklyn nets depth others are skeptical of the type of production to expect out of their aging superstars and theyre all legitimate fears but every time i take a look at this roster those fears starts to fade this lineup is stacked from top to bottom between the fulltime centerpieces and parttime reserves the only thing id fear if i were a nets fan is the durability of deron williams brook lopez and a few of the new yet ancient acquisitions but thats out of everyones control otherwise the moves brooklyn made this summer should propel it to a whole new level its just so rare for a team to have the financial means and roster flexibility to add a trio like kevin garnett paul pierce and jason terry and be able to fit them into the roster so seamlessly its as if the nets were on an nba version of supermarket sweep and grabbed everything they needed from bostons shelves they got a goto guy some interior defense and rebounding a sixth man championship experience and a whole lot of leadership that money cant buy ned dishman getty images a frontcourt of lopez garnett and pierce is one that is able to offer interior offense post defense outside shooting and scoring from the wing garnett recently spokeabout how impressed hes been with lopez whos now up to pounds of solid muscle garnett told roderick boone of newsday im just in awe a little bit just being honest with everybody in reference to lopez despite the additions lopez remains the xfactor in brooklyns lineup giving it its toughest offensive mismatch and top option for halfcourt points with so many shooters around him lopez could be even more effective in the post this upcoming year the backcourtthough i admire them as individual players i was never in love with the idea of making williams and joe johnson veteran team leaders neither have the personality or qualifications to shoulder such a responsibility for a title contender but the new guys do they should take some of the pressure off williams and johnson on and off the court on it theyretwo sub43percent shooters who combined to take roughly shots a game last season with the additions of pierce and garnett we should see a little more efficiency and balance in a lineup that no longer has to rely so heavily on two perimeter scorers geoff burkeusa today sports and though jason terry has lost some of his jet fuel hes still a valuable option off the bench considering how much firepower the nets have in their starting lineup they wont need terry to win any awards off the bench as long as hes out there making the open shots that find him terry brings something to brooklyns table between williams johnson terry and shaun livingston its tough to find much to complain about benchthe signing of andrei kirilenko was huge hes now brooklyns token jackofalltrades guythe player who represents the glue between the other four players on the floor hes out there to do whatever it takes on each possession to increase the teams odds of success whether thats making a pass cleaning the glass sneaking backdoor or spotting up in the corner he also gives them a defensive weapon and ballstoppersomeone who can afford to pick up fouls and irritate opposing scorers brooklyn can also mix and match with reggie evans a bully and mason plumlee an athlete and though hes a liability for a boneheaded play or two andray blatche can put points on the board with a second unit consisting of terry kirilenko and blatche along with specialist reserves in plumlee and evans i wouldnt classify brooklyns bench as much of a weakness at all championship caliber roster are the brooklyn nets a realistic title contender theyre a legit threat to win the nba titletheyre in the picture but they cant escape both miami and chicago nope secondround playoff ceilingsubmit votevote to see resultsare the brooklyn nets a realistic title contender theyre a legit threat to win the nba title55 theyre in the picture but they cant escape both miami and chicago nope secondround playoff ceiling8 total votes if br polldata br polldata if br polldata br polldata id question are the brooklyn nets a realistic title contender choices choice0 count choice theyre a legit threat to win the nba title choice6 count choice choice1 count choice theyre in the picture but they cant escape both miami and chicago choice7 count choice choice2 count choice nope secondround playoff ceiling choice8 count choice choice3 count choice choice9 count choice choice4 count choice choice5 count choice sidebar false if br poll br poll showresults false
4 no nba team has ever complained about having too many sevenfooters piecing together a rotation in which those sevenfooters coexist effectively is a different question altogether its a difficult one too especially for a coach who privileges speed and shooting over sizeand for a team that struggled to make the most of dwight howard and pau gasol last season the central challenge for the los angeles lakers isnt just about replacing howard its about putting his replacement in a position to succeed alongside gasol that replacement of course is 31yearold center chris kaman though kaman only has one allstar appearance in to show for his 10year career his ability to fill howards shoes shouldnt be measured in accolades alone what kaman lacks in dominance he makes up for with the specific skills he brings to head coach mike dantonis system and you can take dantonis word for it according to the los angeles daily news mark medina i dont traditionally love two bigs together they have nice chemistry and theyre skilled for his part kaman isnt just skilled in an abstract sensehe has the makings of a cohort who fits nicely into the lakers program point guard steve nash is already taking notice and his body of iconic work makes him a pretty good judge of these things per espnlosangeles coms ramona shelburne we knew pau was great with the ball but i thought chris was terrific tonight with the ball and setting picks and moving so we didnt get stagnant i was pleasantly surprised i would say it exceeded my expectations will lakers fans be in store for similar sentiments the preseason sample size has been too small and inconsequential to make any lasting judgements but this much is certain in principle this bigman tandem just might work in many respects kaman is a middleclass mans gasol they both understand the game theyre both willing passers sometimes to a fault and theyre both capable shooters their dynamic wellrounded games are already translating into the kind of highlow opportunities youd like to see when two legitimate bigs are on the floor at the same time moreover their effectiveness from the highpost gives dantoni options he sorely missed last season dominant as dwight howard may be around the basket its no secret he yields diminishing returns with every step he takes away from it kaman is a qualitatively different story even if also a qualitatively less sexy one he earned himself a fiveyear million deal with the los angeles clippers back in after just his third pro season having proven himself a capable doubledouble threat the doublefigured annual paycheck made pretty good sense that he now finds himself making just under million on a oneyear pact with the lakers says more about the new nba marketplace than it does kaman the points and rebounds he averaged last season had more to do with playing just minutes a game than it did with diminished ability last time kaman received minutes commensurate with that ability in he put up points and points per contest injuries and trade intrigue in the two subsequent seasons caused a downturn in that production a fact thats led onlookers like espndallas coms jeff caplan to speculate kaman was either injury prone or unlucky even so hes remained more reliable than most his size at least when hes on the floor if dantonis principally concerned with putting his best talent on the floor kaman has to be part of that equation more importantly los angeles cant afford to leave the extra size out of that equation kaman certainly isnt a howardcaliber shotblocker notwithstanding the he somehow averaged during the campaign but the lakers cant afford to be choosy here they need all hands on deck swatting away the interior shots sure to proliferate on account of a porous perimeter defense to be sure there are real concerns about kaman and gasols ability to do some important things on the defensive endlike guarding the pickandroll but again this clubs options are limited though it could look into acquiring a somewhat affordable defensive specialist to patrol the paint it would almost certainly trade off with pooling the kind of offensive assets dantoni prefers such is the offensedefense doublebind for a team thats looking to produce an awful lot of offense if lakers fans learned anything last season though its that nothings perfect even the bestlaid plans sometimes go awry maybe the backup plans will work out better after all
4 out of excuses dripping in controversy and still in search of an nba title dwight howards legacy remains a mystery if howard was to end his career now hed be remembered as an indecisive selfserving ringchaser without any rings playing for three different teams in three seasons doesnt reflect well on a dominant big man and supposed superstar in fact ive come to wonder if his selfimposed buffoonery would be tolerated as much if he played a more common position like point guard or forward allstar talent at other positions arent necessarily dime a dozen but they are more frequent dominant centers are a rarer commodity only a handful of players are equipped to play the and even fewer of those are worthy being deemed stars as a seventime allstar howard is most certainly a star and one of the best there currently is at his position postcareer reputations dont brownnose that kind of standing though stats matter and always will but when all is said done wrapped and sealed titles and leadership mean more than raw talent or unfulfilled potential statistical dominance d clarke evans getty images theres something to be said about howards campaign hampered by back and shoulder injuries and constant questions regarding his future with the los angeles lakers he still earned an allstar selection while posting averages of points rebounds and blocks per game in an off year most other big men will kill for those numbers his alleged regression would serve as their ascension freethrow shooting remains his kryptonite but thats true of so many others that its almost sad poor shooting is a somewhat accepted weakness when you tower over just about everyone else shaquille oneal a fourtime champion threetime nba finals mvp and future hall of famer was one of the greatest big men to ever play the game in spite of his percent showing from the foul line for his career though howard hasnt converted more than percent of his attempts from the charity stripe the past two seasons his percent career clip exceeds that of shaqs and can be overlooked in the long haul deficient foul shooting is one part of his game hackahoward strategies are effective and thats unfortunate but hes still a powerful finisher dominant rebounder and intimidating shotblocker howards oncourt accomplishments will never be overlooked with nine seasons in the books howard enters his 10th with career marks of points rebounds and blocks only six other players in league history notched at least and two respectively through their first nine yearskareem abduljabbar tim duncan shaquille oneal elvin hayes artis gilmore and hakeem olajuwon or four hall of famers and two surefire future inductees also only kareem and hayes matched or surpassed howards total in all three categories making him part of an exclusive club matching the output of legends has never been a problem for him looking ahead if hes able to sustain his high level of play off years included hell go down as one of the most demonstrative bigs there ever was ensuring that part of his legacy will be just fine show me the rings joe murphy getty images zero thats how many championships howard has won hes made one finals appearance but remains ringless the catch has always been that he hasnt had a talented enough supporting cast today multiple superstars are needed to win titles thanks to superteams cropping up like gold diggers at a mens 50andolder yacht party andrew d bernstein getty images kobe and the lakers werent enough for howard maybe harden and the rockets are once he was traded to the lakers that was supposed to change kobe bryant pau gasol and steve nash were the star companions he never had and los angeles was the booming market he never played in injuries and a lack of chemistry derailed what should have been a championshipcaliber season and howard was provided with another excuse since joining the houston rockets howard is out of explanationsall of them houstons core is healthy young and hes playing alongside a top10 star in james harden most importantly he handpicked them it wasnt the other way around but is it perhaps too late too little to erase the last few years maybe there is still plenty to be revealed about the potential of howard and his new team so theres no way of truly telling as he prepares for his 10th season however its clear he still has significant inroads to make if he wishes to match the championship output of players he will forever be pitted against doug benc getty images shaq and duncan won titles howard must do the same shaq had two rings through nine seasons kareem had one duncan had three and gilmore had one aba guys like david robinson hayes and olajuwon had none just like howard but they were able to win later on the admiral and the dream finished with two apiece and hayes grabbed one as well when talking legacy rings matter even more so for howard because hes jumped around so much in the prime of his career duncan like robinson isnt going anywhere save for a lone season in toronto olajuwon didnt either and while shaq and kareem moved around they unlike howard won for him to be remembered as fondly as they are for him to skirt the many selfimposed obstacles in his way he has to win not just gameschampionships on the wrong path troy taorminausa today sports moses malones name hasnt been dropped thus far not deliberately but not sheepishly either although he was another positionally dominant center20 points and rebounds for his careerwith a championship to his name hes overlooked in the very conversation were holding malone played for seven different teams during his 19year nba career it wasnt until he landed with the philadelphia 76ers did he win a title still productive at the time malone took a backseat to julius erving following his lead to a championship when he left philly it was a amidst torrents of controversy selfish acts such as deserting the team after sustaining an injury during the playoffs and discussing the possibility of a trade on television damaged his lasting reputationis he universally hated not even close much like rebecca black after she released an awful song about a day of the week i refuse to mention he was briefly hated then dismissed even if subconsciously but he is dismissed even if subconsciously howard is walking that same tightrope already having forced his way out of orlando only to abandon the lakers shortly after now hes in houston riding hardens coattails no matter what the two may say a perfect match or one that could damage howards reputation it was harden who carried the rockets to the playoffs in had he never been traded to houston howard wouldnt be playing in houston thats a fact in before harden was with the team per nba coms david aldridge howard was opposed to playing for the rockets he didnt suddenly change his mind randomly superman left orlando left los angeles to ride hardens momentum towards a title the attainment of one doesnt mean its a tainted achievement lebron james titles wont have asterisks next to them any ones secured by howard in houston or anywhere else wont either failing to win one to doing what he arrived in houston to do though will hurt him all the controversy compounded by the absence of a title will leave him in danger of being overlooked of being a stathoarding teamjumping championshipseeking big man who wasnt ever quite good enough to win it all how will we remember him thomas b shea getty images one of the greats or almost great howard isnt malone and likely never will be which is a good thing while hes bounced around quite a bit over the last three years hes already proved he can yield the type of results fellow legendary big men can that all great players have of the players in league history who were selected to at least three allstar games during the first nine years of their careers howard ranks 28th in win shares ahead of dwyane wade malone hayes and kobe among others aside from his foul shooting theres no questioning his ability to win saying the same of him as a leader is impossible right now the way in which he left orlando and the circumstances under which he left los angeles

4 my imagination tends to run a little wild when it comes to nba trade ideas and bill simmons has thrown a few out during his season preview with jalen rose that i cant help but analyze in their forecast of the sacramento kings simmons suggested that the new ownership may try to make a splash and acquire rajon rondo from the boston celtics take a listen so the deal as constructed by simmons goes as follows the celtics give up rondo gerald wallace and marshon brooks in exchange for the expiring contracts of john salmons patrick patterson jimmer fredette and greivis vasquez as well as rookie ben mclemore first of all that megadeal wouldnt fly under current cba rules on trades because the kings would be acquiring too much money adding chuck hayes to the celtics haul makes it work in espns nba trade machine check out the deal here and even though hayes deal isnt expiring its significantly less painful to bear than wallaces salaries and technicalities aside this trade is obviously about rondo and mclemore at its core and i may have disagreed with simmons on his notion of trading rudy gay to the utah jazz but i think hes onto something with this one the celtics are on the precipice of a fullscale rebuilding after already trading kevin garnett and paul pierce to the brooklyn nets the only step that hasnt been taken is shipping rondo out and according to espns marc stein it may only be a matter of time before it happens in his latest power rankings stein said they have to trade rajon rondo you know it i know it everyone in basketball knows it this group of young prospects and expiring contracts would probably have to be sweetened up with some future draft considerations combine that with the primary pieces and itshould make general manager danny ainge at least think about pulling the trigger why it works for boston rocky widner getty images between the three of them rondo wallace and brooks are owed nearly million over the next three seasons the total value of the incoming contracts from sacramento would be worth right around million and as stated earlier four of those deals either will or can by not exercising options or making qualifying offers expire this summer the only two theydhaveto pay next year are mclemore and hayes a rebuilding team should look at that kind of savings the way a couponer looks at the sunday paper and as an added benefit the celtics would get some promising prospects who can be a part of the new teams future ben mclemore may have slid to the no pick in this past summers draft but some feel he may be the most talented player in this class as a freshman at kansas the wing averaged points while hitting percent of his threepoint attempts and at the draft combine he showed he has the potential to be more than just a spotup shooter measuring a wingspan and a 42inch vertical leap another prospect they could be intrigued by is jimmer fredette after jimmermania swept over the nation during the ncaa season sacramento picked up the former byu guard with the no pick in the draft but he never fit in with the kings especially after his biggest fan in the organizationcoach paul westphalwas fired seven games into jimmers rookie season despite never being surrounded by consistency both on the floor and off and never having a defined role jimmer still managed to emerge as a capable threepoint specialist last yearhitting percent of his longrange attempts his skills would almost certainly be better utilized by brad stevens in bostonwho made a living at butler getting more out of his seemingly less athletic players than experts thought possible why it works for sacramento rocky widner getty images the kings would be sacrificing some enticing potential by giving up mclemore and theyd be saddled with a pretty tough financial burden in wallaces contract but landing rondo could put them in the hunt for a playoff spot and would definitely make life easier for demarcus cousins rondo is arguably the best distributor in the nba leading the league in assists per game the last two seasons and averaging over in each of the last three his career assist percentage is fifth all time hes also a premier defender on the perimeter the upgrade on both ends of the floor would be visible and immediate trading six players in exchange for three might leave the cupboard somewhat bare but imagine a starting five of rondo brooks wallace carl landry and cousins spots six through are going to be extremely tight this year but that group might have the potential to squeeze into the postseason does it

4 expectations havent changed for carmelo anthonys new york knicks but the path to championship glory looks as steep as ever this summer anthony and his cashstrapped knicks remained largely idle while the top half of the eastern conference grew stronger by the day new yorks closest rivals the brooklyn nets retooled their already loaded roster with a host of proven performers kevin garnett paul pierce jason terry and andrei kirilenko the chicago bulls saw the return of their fallen leader derrick rose the indiana pacers brought back their own former allstar danny granger and stocked their reserve unit with experience luis scola and perimeter shooting chris copeland c j watson the miami heat simply reloaded for a fourth straight run at the nba finals they lost one key contributor mike miller but gambled on a pair of boomorbust players greg oden and michael beasley that they dont really need but would be happy to have and then there was new york with pennies to plug its roster holes truth be told the knicks offseason haulandrea bargnani metta world peace beno udrih and tim hardaway jr was impressive considering the meager funds former general manager glen grunwald had at his disposal but it wasnt the kind of summer the rest of the eastern conference powers enjoyed lacking any dynamic additions to the roster anthonys challenge for is the same as it was last season put this team on his shoulders and carry it as far as he can go but has that struggle gotten any easier for the reigning scoring champ or is this burden now heavy enough to propel him out of the big apple next summer help wanteddespite the writing on the wall anthonys offseason strategy was incredibly optimistic via marc berman of thenew york post a source close to anthony said the sixtime allstar hoped the franchise could find a legitimate secondary scorer over the summer it was a logical request to fill an obvious need for anyone who watched last seasons knicks with microwave scorer j r smith as the second most reliable offensive threat points per game anthony needed help usa today sports but it was a risky ploy no matter how you spin bermans story theres no way to get around the fact that anthony didnt believe this team had championship potential and given those aforementioned cap constraints this was largely the same group of players hed have around him in while that second scorer never surfaced though anthony should have more help this time around as far as the offseason additions go bargnani is poised to make the biggest impact the key is to view bargnani in the right lightnot as a failed top selection but as a 27yearold 7footer with threepoint range career percent whos just one season removed from a scoring average which bargnani will the knicks get seasonppgfg

need bargnani to be dominant the way his former employer the toronto raptors did what they need is for him to spread the floor so anthony can continue his dominance on the low block and help shore up new yorks rebounding woes rebounding percentage 17th last season tempered expectations should also be applied to the arrival of newcomer world peace the queensbridge native and fourtime nba alldefensive team selection is years old father time has sapped his ability to keep pace with the athletic specimens flooding the league but he brings his own value to the hardwood hes not a knockdown shooter career threepoint percentage but he can be effective when hes mindful of his shot selection percent between and not to mention he has the size lbs to defend the low block which eases some of the physical punishment on anthony when hes playing the and theres reason to hope for more help from anthonys returning teammates iman shumperts athleticism returned late last season after the guards lengthy rehab from a torn acl he has already made a dramatic appearance in the preseason but more intriguing for knicks fans is his improved shooting stroke always a rugged defender the former georgia tech star has the chance to be just as special at the opposite end of players with at least playoff appearances in only he and ray allen shot above percent from deep and percent at the line amare stoudemire is another year older and another year wiser in terms of dealing with his nagging injuries even if under a minutes restriction he averaged last season he can still be effective in limited doses points per minutes fieldgoal percentage player efficiency rating as for smith maybe that looming fivegame suspension will be his wakeup call like mike woodson told espn new yorks ian begley its time for smith to grow up his maturation on and off the floor would be a godsend for this franchise he has the talent to be that second option that anthony wants especially if he becomes more discerning about his shot selectionthe puzzle for anthony will be figuring out how to maximize these new weapons without sacrificing the efficiency he exhibited last season hes been working with trainer idan ravin to finetune his offensive game but its on him to put these new tools to work the struggle withinnew yorks roster changes might not have been dramatic this summer but the way they affect anthonys usage could be despite anthonys scorching run as an undersized last season career best player efficiency rating and win shares he could be on the move back to his natural spot at the per mitch lawrence of thenew york daily news woodson plans to stick with the same starting frontcourt he trotted out for the teams first preseason gameanthony andrea bargnani and tyson chandler anthony himself has signed off on the arrangement via begley carmelo anthony said hed have no problem sliding to sf when sharing the floor w bargnani but believes hell get plenty of time in the post ian begley ianbegley october 2013anthonys right this setup doesnt entirely preclude him from playing the post but it figures to limit his touches on the low block bargnani can stray from the basket on occasion but hes not the kind of player who can afford to live out on the wing anthonys far from the worst decisionmaker in the league but there have been points in his career when hes gotten a little jumpshot happy for a player with as many offensive weapons as he hascombined with the offensive slant of the per categoryhe should have something better than a career per as his teams unchallenged best scorer hes in a bit of a tough spot a number of prolific scorers get too balldominant at times but anthony still has to pick his spots wisely last season he was lethal in his offensive execution he became just the 10th player in nba history to average at least points and fewer than turnovers and the first to do so since tracy mcgrady achieved the feat in but being so close to the basket anthony had less time to think as soon as he caught the ball in the post he had to instantly read and react to the defense if help crashed hed find one of new yorks gunners on the outside if it didnt come hed bully his way to baskets or free throws brian spurlockusa today sports this season those reads will take longer to develop double teams wont come as quickly and when they do hell likely be making those reads on the move the first open shot isnt always the best remember these are mike woodsons knicks not mike dantonis anthonys quickfire first step will give him an offensive advantage more often than not but its those second and third steps that really matter the ones that can take him from the dead zone of midrange jumpers into that realm of efficiency known as the paint he still has shooters to find when help perimeter defenders drop down too far and finishers in chandler stoudemire and kenyon martin should defensive help come from underneath if anthonys an unselfish scorer new yorks ceiling goes beyond last seasons 54win total if not well lets just say the ramifications could be felt well beyond melodramatic conclusionthe countdown is underway in new york and its not the one tracking the time until the knicks regularseason opener on oct anthony watch is on in full force as he sits less than months away from deciding whether to opt out of the final year of his current contract its more of a formality than anything anything close to a repeat performance of his effort will ensure the 29yearold another major payday nathaniel s butler getty images but that doesnt mean hell be filling out a changeofaddress form next summer he could simply resign with the knicks something espns stephen a smith says has a chance of happening via arash markazi of espn los angeles the willheorwonthe question will surround this team all season no matter how hard he tries to bury the topic if hes still swimming in blue and orange beyond next summer that means hes willing to buy this teams title potential he told msg networks alan hahn he thinks the knicks improved over the offseason this year we got guys that can help us all across the board down on the block out on the wing defensively just overall as a group i feel we have a better team than last year and thats saying a lot because we had a real good team last year and that appreciation of his teammates will

because he feared for less playing opportunities with gordon coming on board hill lyons and parrom exhausted their eligibility the uncertainty of what lies ahead and quality depth issues caused miller to tell reporters during the teams media day that he has tempered enthusiasm about his team some preseason publications differ on their opinion about arizona the sporting news ranks arizona no in its preseason poll lindys sports rates the wildcats out of the top at no via tucsoncitizen com its just the way it goes miller said about the preseason hype but i do believe with where were rated how good were supposed to be we may not be that good i dont know yet he also does not know his rotation that should be developed by the time the wildcats start pac12 play on jan against washington state in tucson here is a glimpse of how the rotation from nos to should evolve starters christian petersen getty images sean miller is setting his sights high on a solid eight to 10man rotation mcconnell point guard miller lauds mcconnell for his defense and how that can translate to highpercentage scoring opportunities at the other end mcconnell averaged steals per game in each of his first two seasons at duquesne which was fourth nationally his freshman year and third as a sophomore 2 johnson shooting guard he is arizonas best returning threepoint shooter percent mcconnells defense and playmaking skills should give johnson plenty of opportunities to get good looks and improve upon his scoring average of points a game 3 gordon wing look for him to start at the wing position if miller decides to go big by starting sophomore brandon ashley at power forward gordon who prides himself taking a defender to the basket from the perimeter will start at power forward if miller decides to go with a smaller lineup and include hollisjefferson 4 ashley power forward the sophomore who was inconsistent last season told foxsportsarizona com that he lived in the gym this summer and added pounds he worked on his perimeter game and passing brandon is sometimes is the guy not a lot of people are talking about miller said hes worked hard on his shot 5 tarzcewski center the 250pound post player

experience in millers system bench jeff gross getty images jordin mayes can become the xfactor for arizona as an invaluable backup on the perimeter hollisjefferson wing rated by 247sports com as the 18thbest prospect of the class of hollisjefferson will get his share of minutes he will start in place of ashley if miller decides to go small in this case gordon would shift to power forward 7 mayes point guard the only senior on the team mayes should develop into a leader despite his quiet nature beset by injuries and a lack of confidence in his shot the last couple of years mayes should improve with increased responsibility and the presence of new assistant coach damon stoudamire a former arizona player who is a lifelong family friend of mayes 8 peters center miller presented his case firmly to the ncaa that peters should gain immediate eligibility after transferring from kansas peters enrolled at kansas but never played after attending the fall semester normally transfers must sit a full academic calendar meaning peters would be eligible in the spring but peters gained an exception because of his medical condition miller needs peters who is and pounds to bolster the frontline 9 gabe york shooting guard a highlytouted shooting prospect entering his freshman season last year york rarely had playing opportunities because of his defense york can help fill the threepoint shooting the wildcats lost from last season and miller reportedly is encouraged by yorks improvement on defense 10 matt korcheck power forward the junior college transfer adds muchneeded muscle and pounds to the frontcourt miller will call upon him to spell gordon ashley tarczewski and peters he also provides five more fouls for arizona when necessary the last recruited scholarship player is freshman shooting

4 when brett brown signed a fouryear contract to take the philadelphia sixers head coaching job in august he did so with the understanding that it was going to be an uphill climb from day after trading away two of their best playersandre iguodala and jrue holidayover the course of months philadelphias cabinet was bare in steps brown a longtime san antonio spurs assistant with zero head coaching experience at the nba level while the immediate future of the sixers is bleakand thats putting it nicelyhere are a few keys that brown needs to focus on if he wants to restore the franchise to relevance rely on the young guysbetween michael carterwilliams tony wroten and even royce white the sixers have at least three guys with the potential to be productive players when healthy nerlens noel is also a part of this group carterwilliams the 11th overall pick by the sixers this past april was chosen because of his athleticism and size at the point guard position as someone who can score and dish it out to his teammates as well hes a good piece of the puzzle in philadelphias rebuilding process wroten was a firstround draft choice of the memphis grizzlies last year but didnt see much time before being traded to the sixers in the offseason while his decision to leave the university of washington after his freshman campaign was questionable from a development standpoint he has enough talent to draw comparisons to tyreke evansif he pans out white is the biggest wild card of them all suffering from a severe anxiety disorder that causes him to fear flying while those issues have held him back so far in his career he still has potential and was even compared to lebron james according tothis july article from sports illustrateds pablo torre if brown wants to build for the future he needs to establish these players now with the prospects of two top10 picks in a strong draft its hard to imagine the sixers retaining evan turner and thad young past this season carterwilliams and wroten need to be given opportunities on a consistent basis brown needs to throw them into the fire instead of easing them in he has to let them learn throughrepetition whites situation is different but if hes healthy enough to play consistently he should get every possibleopportunityto showcase his talent after all he has the potential give carterwilliams the ball with five seconds left on the clock let wroten play freely and drive the lane at will the development of philadelphias young talent isnt going to come by holding them back its going to come by letting them learn on the runeven if that means a rocky first year dont rush noel backwhen the sixers pulled the trigger and sent holiday to new orleans the initial reaction in philadelphia was that of disbelief but when the dust settled the mental image of nerlens noel roaming the paint in philadelphia helped relieve the stinga lot projected for quite some time as the no overall pick noel slipped all the way to new orleans at no due to an acl injury he suffered in february the notion that he was injury prone was unfair to say the leastthe incident occurred after he landed awkwardly trying to block a shot it would be a lot more concerning if the injury occurred by simply running or changing direction while noel is arguably the most exciting sixers draft pick in a long timeid go as far as to say more exciting than evan turner wasthey dont need him now the presence of noel in the lineup isnt going to make philadelphia a contender by any means so its browns job to allow the youngster to take as much time as he needs there will be only two months left in the season when noel is a year removed from his knee injury and by that time the sixers will be so far back in the standings that they shelve noel to avoid any further damage keeping him out the whole year wont hurt their chances at the no overall pick in the draft either if their interaction with each other in this video is any indication it seems as though brown and noel have already developed a good relationship theyll have at least four years to continue to grow that relationship on the court so brown needs to be patient with his future defensive star and allow noel to come back when he feels ready be honest and interact with the fansif weve learned anything so far from sam hinkies short time as general manager its that hes not going to sugarcoat anything hell tell you how it is and that was evident during the postdraft introductory press conference we should keep our end goal in mind which is to build a championship caliber team in philly hinkie said per nba com that wont come overnight thats not a surprise we started down that path last night well keep climbing and well try to keep climbing a hill that we think ends somewhere that well all be proud of for philadelphia fans this is a breath of fresh air for the past several seasons theyve watched as the eagles flyers and phillies made big moves in an attempt to secure a championship only to see those moves backfire and ownership not right the wrong before it was too late hinkie on the other hand recognized there was a problem and is now starting to fix it this team is bad right now but that doesnt mean hes not going to try his hardest to fix it the difference between the sixers and the other philadelphia franchises is that the sixers arent going to try to get better by stockpiling top talent theyre going to get better by drafting young players theyre going to build brown needs to convey that same philosophy especially when interacting with the media and fans no matter how much the truth might hurt right now theres nothing more refreshing than a franchise and its coach telling you like it isand then telling you theyre working to make it better that work started off on the right foot this offseason its going to be hard for the sixers to keep the casual fan interested this year considering how bad theyll be and brown cant afford to be a coach who doesnt want to make himself a visible part of the franchise things like getting involved in the community and being involved from a marketing standpoint are just a few ways that he can interact with fans to foster interest in the sixers although they are in the cellar of philadelphia sports right now that might not be the case five years in the future the sixers need to plant the seed of hope this season and that starts with brownon and off the court he has his work cut out for him but if brown is able to develop his young players and exude a positive energy off the court the franchise will be headed in the right direction with the chance of two lottery picks next year many sixers fans wouldnt mind a horrid season nowbut that shouldnt come at the expense of brown and company starting to build something for the future

4 the indiana pacers made the absolute right move in makingthe versatile paul george their franchise player to the tune of million not making the danny granger mistake certainly granger is a good player in his own right he had his chances to take indiana to the next level when he was its franchise player culminating with the team making backtoback playoff appearances in firstround loss to the chicago bulls and secondround loss to the miami heat however as they say everything happens for a reason fate intervened when grangers patellar tendinosis jumpers knee injury sidelined him for all but five games in the nba season many nba experts thought the pacers were goners and then all of a sudden out of nowhere the once timid and gunshy george served notice he is a legitimate force to be reckoned with he established career highs in virtually every statistical category en route to copping several nba accolades including nba allstar nba most improved player nba alldefensive second team and allnba third team honors now he is the indiana pacers franchise player as for granger who becomes a free agent in he will now play a supporting role alongside george this season the danny granger mistakedanny grangers highlightswhen the indiana pacers selected danny granger 17th overall in the nba draft they thought it was an absolute stroke of good fortune nobody expected granger to fall that low thenpacers head coach rick carlisle raved about their newest rookie per pacers coms conrad brunner if we wouldve had the fifth pick he wouldve been the best player available thats how strongly we felt about danny grangers abilities to not only play in this league but contribute on our team were very fortunate tonight and very happy granger made good progress in his first three nba seasons on july former franchise player jermaine onealwas traded to the toronto raptorsa deal that also brought roy hibbert to indianapolis this paved the way for granger tosigna fiveyear extension four months later to the tune of an estimated million which kicked in during the season the next two seasons were the pinnacle of his nba career averaging a teamhigh points and points respectively his production dipped somewhat in the next two years when the pacers lost to the bulls and heat in the postseason now on to the bigger picture heres how the indiana pacers fared when danny granger was their

nbauniverse comwas it entirely grangers fault indiana couldnt get it going when he was its franchise player absolutely not management has to take part of the blame for this for the most part the inept jim obrien was the pacers head coach when granger became their main man granger also didnt have a good supporting cast take for instance the squad which went although roy hibbert was already around that time he wasnt the great wall of hibbert as we know him today instead indiana had to settle for the likes of brandon rush mike dunleavy troy murphy and josh mcroberts how granger put up with all of the mediocrity in spite of his big bucks is something to marvel at paul george the real dealthe top plays of paul georges careerpaul george is really the perfect franchise player for the indiana pacers he has superstar talent can score in a variety of ways defend the best wing players on the opposing team and rebound tenaciously george also has an exemplary work ethic and a willingness to commit long term to the indiana pacers a separate article by this author about him being the perfect franchise player can be read here in fairness to granger he is also an ideal franchise player he is a proven scorer an underrated defender and a person with good character its just that george beats him by a mile in several aspects granger is nowhere near the defender and rebounder george is georges major nba accolades in just his third season when he averaged points should be a sign of great things to come with his upside he has what it takes to become the first mvp for the pacers in nba history coincidentally he also peaked at the right time with a great coach in frank vogel and a solid supporting cast hibbert david west george hill lance stephenson etc several factors that granger did not have when he became indys franchise player in granger just happened to be the best player the indiana pacers had back then the final say danny granger talks about paul george as the nba most improved player danny granger was given a golden opportunity to bring the indiana pacers to neverbeforereached heights when he became their franchise player five years ago granger tried as best as he could but a weak coach and supporting cast held him back in a big way other factors that came into playand which granger had no control overwere his unfortunate jumpers knee injury and the rise to prominence of

4 through a pair of preseason games jeff green hasnt exactly looked the part of theboston celtics goto scorer not to worry though as his minutes and role have been merely a means of conditioning and experimentation he has shot 6of17 and 2of10 from beyond the arc which arent thrilling numbers from a supposed star but take it all with a grain of salt at this point there is still plenty of time to figure out how he will be effective this season what is being requested of green this year is pretty clear the celtics front office has plowed the road for him to be successful he even has a small personal mantra courtesy of kevin garnetts foul mouth step be aggressive be aggressive celtics f jeff green invoked kevin garnett several times said he taught him the need to be asshole on court noted hes enemey now scott souza scott souza september 2013it is totally possible that that is all green needs as a blueprint to be successful it will all wind up stemming from how comfortable he can be playing aggressively in the spotlight this is absolutely not an easy task as there are few who can handle it on a nightly basis still by all accounts and from a healthy chunk of time watching green play we can see he has the godgiven physical attributes he has roughly the same body as kevin durant and is just a couple pounds lighter than lebron james however greens game has never been confused with one of them what percentage of that reason has been opportunity ability or mentality should be discovered before the finale so greens blueprint starts with exactly how garnett so eloquently put it if green chooses to embrace the role of a spotlighted player then we can advance on to the next step step go left no really go leftlook at the difficulty level on some of these righthanded drives admittedly this has probably become a bit overblown at this point but that it has become so noticeable illustrates that it is indeed a problem jeff green favors his right hand quite often and can become incredibly predictable it makes his successful trips down the right side of the paint look more spectacular as he is typically carving through two or more defenders but it also expends too much energy simply switching it up a little more often will lighten his load on any particular possession keeping him fresh throughout the game green is looking at about a 10minutepergame increase along with four or five more fieldgoal attempts that is a workload his body isnt accustomed to versatility will be key mixing it up will also help his teammates be more involved they will be attempting to cut out roles for themselves as well having a versatile green will help them experiment with different looks and skill sets step dont be shy utilize wallacemoving from paul pierce to gerald wallace as a positionmate did numerous things for jeff green obviously it opened up a starting and starring role for green to presumably fill right in perhaps under the covers a bit is another important factor that came out of the brooklyn nets trade wallace might just be a better role model for green to follow yes fans and analysts want green to be better than wallace ever was and they have every reason to think and hope that it will be the case keep in mind though that with wallace we are talking about a wellestablished 12year nba veteran who has put up some very good numbers throughout his career we cant yet say any of that about green what to look at in this step is the stylistic comparisons green was never able to really get his game going at peak efficiency and performance with pierce clogging the depth chart however he was also attempting to learn from bostons former captain an admirable try but maybe not the best route for his career to develop pierce was a crafty offensive player with an ineffable knack for getting to the basket when needed or creating space where there was none to get off a jumper wallace has made a living being hyperathletic and using reckless abandon in the most graceful way possible to get to the rim and the line now ask yourself which of those two is jeff green more likely to resemble step fill what is neededthis step should be for green to not be something he isnt but rajon rondos extended recovery time is throwing a monkey wrench into a great many plans the point is green shouldnt try do too much this isnt to say green should shy away from anything it would just be beneficial to avoid a buttermakertellingkelly leaktocatchalltheflyballssituation rondo will be the one who sets bostons tone green can be the teams goto scorer without being forced to play like carmelo anthony once his allstar point guard returns green should focus on filling holes in bostons lineup that may mean working on his threepoint shooting as there are no elite marksmen on the roster it may also mean covering a big shooting guard or fleetfooted power forward as avery bradley and rondo are sometimes too small and jared sullinger kris humphries and brandon bass arent incredibly athletic of course the one people will notice most is filling the lanes on fast breaks if he simply finds the holes and spackles them up nicely rondo will work the ball to him on offense enough to be labeled a goto scorer perhaps without ever looking the part that is how green will prove himself this seasonnot by taking shots a night to average points per game but by becoming a steady reliable option for boston to use on a regular basis follow 3rdstringwalsh
4 james harden is the rare 24yearold whos already the best player at his position hes a foundational franchise leader a fearless player and a relentless scorer when mistakes are made theyre almost always hardens own doing whether hes driving to the rim and barreling over a stationary defender or whipping a bullet pass at an unsuspecting teammate and then watching the ball roll out of bounds his defensive woes are correctable existing more for a lack of effort and energy than knowledge of scheme and design he knows where hes supposed to be and hes a smart player who should get better on that end as his offensive strains loosen up what made his first season as a rocket so special was his ability to assume so much offensive responsibility while remaining extremely efficient he posted a true shooting percentage of percent 14th highest in the league while his usage percentage was an even percent ninth highest in the league only three guards in nba history who appeared in at least games were as high in both categories kevin martin sixtime allstar walter davis and michael jordan jordan and harden are the only two to score at least points making hardens achievement even more remarkable was the stage in his career when he did it layne murdoch getty images harden is already a buzz saw through the leagues thickest defenses with passing ability and court awareness that make him impossible to guard as hes knifing toward the rim when he was the best sixth man in basketball harden was often compared to manu ginobili but last season he vaulted into a new tier kobe bryant and dwyane wade two of the best shooting guards ever are now better measurements despite what bryant and wade might say theyre both no longer as athletic or consistent on both ends of the floor as they used to be wade turns in january and will likely battle knee troubles the rest of his career while bryant is and currently has no timetable for a return to action after suffering a devastating tear to his achilles six months ago evaluating harden by pitting his skill and production against those two in the present day wouldnt be insightful but doing so when bryant and wade were in their early 20s should paint a more accurate picture in predicting hardens future below are some stats from each player when they were years old issac baldizon getty images wade second season as a fulltime starter games minutes ppg rpg apg per usage percentage true shooting percentage allstar allnba second team alldefensive second team bryant fourth season as a fulltime starter games minutes ppg rpg apg per usage percentage true shooting percentage allstar allnba first team alldefensive second team harden first season as a fulltime starter games minutes ppg rpg apg per usage percentage true shooting percentage allstar allnba third team at wade and bryant both had shaquille oneal as a teammate now its hardens turn to have a complementary hall of famecaliber big man by his side the addition of dwight howard is significant because even though harden already has one nba finals appearance under his belt it occurred when he might have been the third or fourthbest player on his team scott halleran getty images a healthy howard assures houston and harden will be contending for a title for the next five years and valid or not great players can make straight allstar teams but if they arent elevating their team to a championship or two history wont think of them as highly earlier i wrote the only thing holding harden back from bursting through his own ceiling was himself but thats not entirely true in order for him to surpass his current expectations hell need the right pieces around him and a sprinkle of luck in the playoffselements every legend in basketball history has needed teamrelated struggles and injuries are variables hell have to outmaneuver but if both fall into place theres no reason to think that years from now we wont view harden as we do wade and bryant today
4 after putting together one of the leagues deepest rosters the big question for the new york knicks right now is who is going to start in according to newsday the only players mike woodson has guaranteed starting roles for next season are raymond felton carmelo anthony and tyson chandler that leavesroom for a shooting guard and another forward the open forward spot has been discussed ad nauseam but it seems like woodson is leaning towards andrea bargnani at the moment which makes sense aswhen healthyhis skill set complements melo perfectly on the offensive end what hasnt been discussed too much however is who will start at shooting guard mostmyself includedexpected iman shumpert to be given the job but woodson has said repeatedly that the spot is up for grabs in training camp considering the success of the dualpoint guard backcourt last year and the depth new york has at the position shumpert and j r smith likely arent alone in competing for the job pablo prigioni who started towards the end of last season could be in contention too lets go through each potential starter and break down who exactly should get the job focusing on their fit with the rest of the unit and how starting them would affect the rotation pablo prigioni usa today sports the knicks were at their best last season with prigioni starting in the backcourt giving the starting shooting guard job to prigioni in march turned out to be one of the best decisions woody made last season during prigionis month in the starting five new york went shocking the league and sealing the no spot in the eastern conference the keys to the knicks success during that run were ball movement and spacing having an experienced passer playing at the made sure that the offense was always flowing and even afforded felton the opportunity to play as a scorer on occassion it also didnt hurt that prigioni proved to be a surprisingly good shooter hitting percent of his shots from beyond the arc during that stretch theres no denying that prigioni fits as a starter from a chemistry standpoint but his presence in the lineup does create a practical problem for the rotation while starting prigioni will create minutes for beno udrih as the backup point guard it also means that shumpert or smith will have to move to forward be that off the bench or as a starter that isnt necessarily a bad thing in a vacuum since both players have experience at the but moving one of them to the frontcourt only serves to create another logjam there with bargnani metta world peace amare stoudemire and kenyon martin theoretically with stoudemire already on a minutes limit the knicks could take that as an opportunity to also give martin and chandler some serious rest in the regular season but considering their importance to the defense that might not be such a good idea with smith out through injury and suspension theres a good chance well see this lineup in the shortterm as we have done already in preseason to see it throughout the year however would be contingent on prigioni and udrih proving that the knicks would be best off shifting their logjam to the frontcourt iman shumpert jeff zelevansky getty images woody is forcing shumpert to earn his starting spot in training camp in the first game of the preseason shumpert responded well to having to compete for his job firmly establishing himself as the frontrunner with a standout performance against the boston celtics shump was 7of7 on the night good for points leading the knicks to victory and making up for the absence of smith with his scoring all summer the talk has been about whether or not shumpert can improve his offensive game and hopefully this is a sign of things to come even last season shumpert made significant strides as a shooter he shot percent from downtown which fits into new yorks offensive system and helps to spread the floor for carmelo anthony defense however is the real reason shump should be starting hes the teams premier perimeter defender which is particularly useful with feltonone of the leagues worst defensive point guardsstarting at the assuming world peace doesnt start that leaves the knicks with a wellbalanced second unit with a mix of both offensive and defensiveminded players having prigioni on the bench also allows him to stick with smith and stoudemire two players who he really started to build chemistry with last season at this point in his career its about time the knicks just gave shumpert a fixed role hes started at three different positions these last two years and it would be best for his development to come into his own where hes looked bestat shooting guard unfortunately with this lineup the knicks will struggle to find minutes for udrih but thats not a terrible problem to have new york really could have used a player of his caliber when felton was injured last year and hell likely be called upon to cover for the injured smith to start the season if he plays well he may just force himself into the rotation j r smith nathaniel s butler getty images the knicks bench needs j r s offense but the starting five is fine without it after earning the sixth man of the year award last season theres a good case to be made that smith is the best shooting guard on the knicks roster unlike in most cases simply being the best player doesnt guarantee smith a starting spot after nine years in the league its pretty clear that hes more suited to coming off the bench and it would be best not to mess with that formula woodson seems to think that smith proved last season that he deserves to start but inconsistency was still a major issue so thats not entirely true while smith did have a careeryear his shot selection remained questionable and his performance in the playoffs showed he still has a way to go before fully making good on his obvious talent keeping smith on the bench ensures that he has to earn his minutes which will help to keep him focused and in line rewarding him with a starting role after his terrible postseason and offseason suspension wouldnt be sending the right message another big issue is the fact that smith is injured right now if the knicks start off well in his absencewhich is very possible if shumpert and tim hardaway jr continue to impress on offenseit wouldnt make sense to mess with the starting five even without the injury with melo in place new york doesnt need another high volume shooter to start they simply need someone who can hit the three which prigioni and shumpert both proved they are capable of last season last but not least the knicks bench needs smith his ability to score in isolation makes the unit one of the strongest in the nba but without him it starts to look old and lacking in energy with bargnani likely starting and stoudemire being kept under wraps as much as possible smith is the clear goto option off the bench as good as hes looked so far in preseason shumpert isnt reliable enough yet offensively to be that player keeping smith on the bench shouldnt be taken as a punishment it simply means that the bench needs his production and the starting five doesnt need another isolation scorer the verdict jesse d garrabrant getty images shumpert makes sense as the starter and that should become a reality based on his early showing in camp regardless of who starts its going to be difficult to fit everyone in the rotation but the best the knicks can do is make sure they have balance in their first and second units for that reasonalong with the fact that hes proving himself so far in campit makes sense for new york to go with shumpert to start the season its hard to argue with prigionis record as a starter but as long as hes playing significant minutes his impact on ball movement should still be felt after all before he was a starter we didnt actually see much of prigioni in as for smith theres plenty of evidence showing hes best utilized as a spark off the bench the knicks need him in that role and could also use shumperts defense on the starting perimeter with smith injured its hard to see why woodson considers this to be a competition but if shumpert continues to look good in preseason it wont be long before hes confirmed as the starter

4 ahmad starks and the fighting illini were not given the message they wanted to hear from the ncaa last week when starks medical hardship waiver was denied leaving him unable to play in the season with darius paul aaron cosby and now starks having to sit out due to transfer regulations only scholarships and one walkon will be able to suit up for john groces squad this season here is a look at each player starting with the teams best 1 rayvonte ricein two years as a member of the drake bulldogs rice scored points with a point average over that span rice is not just a scorer though as he also averaged rebounds assists steals and blocks in his underclassmen years at drake after sitting out last season rice has cut some baby food and turned it into muscle boding well for chances to be successful in the b1g rice is a slasher who went to the foul line over six times per game as a sophomore though he does need to improve on his outside shooting despite minimal experience playing major conference schools rice a champaign product has the toughness as well as skill to be a bigtime player in the nations top league 2 tracy abramsafter upping his scoring average by points from his freshman to sophomore seasons abrams proved he can be a big ten point guard despite questionable decision making at times without brandon paul and d j richardson beside him as they were during his first two seasons abrams will need to be a better distributor of the ball as the illini were one of the nations worst assistperbasket teams in abrams assist to turnover ratio is alarming but should improve with less of an isolation type offense look for abrams to increase his scoring slightly and his minutes drastically 3 nnanna egwuof all the players on the current illini roster egwu has the best chance at making a living playing basketball in the nba while he is still raw egwu put on pounds from this time last season making him a more physical presence in the rugged big ten egwu blocked shots a year ago and could be an alldefensive team performer as a junior egwu has a nice midrange stroke though he needs to become more assertive with the ball in the paint egwu needs to work on his hands and stop picking up cheap fouls but the sky really is the limit with him 4 joseph bertrandon a team full of fresh faces bertrand is the teams veteran as a redshirt senior after a redshirt season and an additional year and a half riding the pine bertrand came into his own midway through his redshirt sophomore season as an efficient scorer who had the ability to take over games he is a freak athlete who can score off the dribble and in transition while also possessing a nice touch on the baseline bertrand had shoulder surgery this past offseason which should help him be more comfortable and aggressive on both ends of the court in this his final year in champaign 5 malcolm hillthe first nonprojected starter to make the list is hill a freshman from belleville illinois hill has a lanky frame at and is a pure scorer with a smooth outside stroke hill finished third in the illinois mr basketball voting in a competition that has become difficult for nonchicagoland players to win recently hill should see plenty of minutes at either wing position and will be needed to be an instant offensive player when hes called off the bench 6 jon ekeybertrand has another fellow redshirt senior in ekey though this will be ekeys first season as an illini ekey is familiar to the area playing in normal at illinois state before transferring to illinois for graduate school and becoming eligible to play immediately ekey should be the starting power forward filling the void that tyler griffey left as a stretch four ekey is a better athlete and defender than griffey while still possessing an excellent outside shooting touch 7 kendrick nunnthe second of five illini freshmen on this list is nunn who comes to u of i from simeon in chicago tate will wear a tradition for simeon players that played at illinois to wear after the tragic death of benji wilson in as he donned that number nunn is a sharpshooting lefty who also has the bounce to create off the dribble nunn may have ballhandling duties depending on the situation but like hill should see plenty of opportunities to play and perform off the illini bench 8 austin colberthere comes the point in the list where there are a lot of question marks of the previous seven players three were key returning players for the illini two were proven transfers and two were highly touted incoming freshmen not to short colbert but he has been described as raw while that term can be thrown around loosely its not necessarily a negative description as i also used it while highlighting egwu earlier colbert will see minutes out of necessity as the illini frontcourt is lacking if colbert can be a poor mans mike davis who played for the illini from that would be a success colbert can bring energy rebounding and defense with that the offense will come eventually 9 maverick morganat and pounds morgan certainly brings size that the illini have lacked in recent years morgan will play backup to egwu who as previously mentioned has a knack for getting in foul trouble similar to colbert morgan wont be needed as a scorer but rather as a minutes eater who can stand his ground in the paint against some skilled big men rebound and defend the basket 10 jaylon tatelike nunn tate hails from chicago powerhouse simeon where he was a part of two state championship teams after transferring in from de la salle midway through his prep career tate is a passfirst point guard who will bring toughness tate has also been described as playing with a chip on his shoulder as tate was passed over as a recruit in favor of teammates nunn jabari parker duke and steve taylor jr marquette 11 mike latulipthe teams lone walkon latulip actually saw the court times as a freshman latulip was ahead of multiple scholarship players on the depth chart a year ago and is in the best shape of any player on the team latulip has a year of college basketball under his belt and knows the illini offense which should make the backup point guard competition between he and tate an intriguing one latulip is also a threepoint shooting threat something the illini may currently lack
4 joakim noah is unquestionably the emotional leader of the chicago bulls hes also the centerpiece of their gritty defense which has ranked as one of the nbas best in recent years while he is recognized for his personality and allaround tenacity how can he take another step and emerge as the defensive player of the year in noah arguably had the best statistical season of his career in tallying points per game rebounds per game assists per game steals per game and blocks per outing the defensive effortsrebounds steals and blockswere particularly impressive the fact that the bulls also gave up the third fewest points per game during also amplifies his value despite this evidence noah did not finish among the top three in the defensive player of the year voting he came in fourth behind marc gasol lebron james and serge ibaka while noah is clearly regarded as one of the games best defenders he must work out a few kinks if he hopes to reign above the rest before we unpack where noah must implement improvements lets first highlight how much he means to the bulls defense by analyzing his strengths heart and hustle mike dinovousa today sports the primary reason why noah is invaluable to coach tom thibodeaus defensive schemes is his heart and hustle he brings the intangibles that advanced statistics cannot quantify noahs aggression and emotion can at times be excessive but these attributes are truthfully seated at the core of why hes effective take away his fire and constant maximum effort and hes probably a belowaverage player with size but not much else the bulls fuel off noah in this manner and it sets the tone for so much of what they do helpside effectiveness anthony gruppusousa today sport a featured area where noah excels is help defense where he shows himself in the lane with precise intellect and timing this is a staple to what the bulls showcase defensively the following screen shot captures an example of this in a bulls playoff contest against the brooklyn nets nets guard joe johnson an adept playmaker off the dribble is looking to create on the wing but noah is hovering in the middle of the driving lane notice that nate robinson is covering brook lopez noahs man while noah is helping the options are thus limited for johnson either he can launch a longrange shot off the dribble skip the ball to inconsistent open shooter gerald wallace or merely swing it to deron williams johnson chucked up a contested deep jumper and it clanked off the rim this is where noahs presence in the lane is instrumental to chicagos defense hes always showing in the gap and in turn he eliminates many dribble drives noah is especially wise when defending a ball screen he knows exactly how much time is necessary to show preventing the dribbler from hoisting a quality look or potentially getting to the rim hes also always ready to quickly return to his man if the ball is kicked there his agile feet surely assist him in this regard here is a screen shot of noah defending joe johnson off a ball screen notice how there is little room for johnson to create anything and also look at how noah remains close enough to lopez where he can recover this led to johnson kicking to andray blatche on the other side of the floor the bulls were more than content to let blatche shoot a long two which he did and it barely hit the rim this epitomizes what the bulls defense does it forces opponents out of their comfort zone and it often leads to illadvised shots or open shots from inefficient shooters perhaps what is most significant about noah as a help defender is that he can adequately switch onto guards he is agile enough to stay in front of ultraquick guards and can also utilize his length to alter their shots off penetrations the following video reveals such an instance in a bulls battle against the miami heat noahs defensive skills are on clear display here not only does he rotate to dwyane wade but he emphatically swats wades attempt is there any other center in the league who is this versatile noah is the total package as a help defender and he is what sparks chicagos defensive mastery hes constantly active hes seemingly always in the right spot he simply models everything that thibodeau desires in their pesky approach room for improvement rob grabowskiusa today sports noah is the anchor for the bulls schemes but he needs to improve his ontheball post defense before hell really make a push for the defensive player of the year hear me on this its not like noah is a poor post defender hes above average there just remains room for improvement before he really reaches an elite level consider his opponent counterpart per minute production ppg rpg and a per of 82games com compare his counterpart per with other notable centers in this chart the discrepancy between noah and other big men in this category isnt vast but it is still revealing for him to establish himself as the cream of the crop on defense he cant lag behind a handful of other centers in such a telling statistic as a result noah must make it a point to suffocate his specific matchup in convincing fashion if he can lower his opponent counterpart per minute per under like marc gasol the defensive player of the year then noahs in ideal position to gather the hardware this is the specific area where noah must work out the kinks so he can prove hes deserving his defense contains very few flaws so a step in the right direction here could be what elevates noah to the top another development that could further enhance noahs case is his defensive plays tally this statistic per hoopdata accumulates blocks steals and charges in noah finished with defensive plays per game this interestingly rated higher than gasol but trailed dwight howard and larry sanders noah was about even with serge ibaka noah can polish his resume by leading the league in this statistic during this coupled with a more productive counterpart per could be the final addition that results in a welldeserved defensive player of the year accolade but can he stay healthy and do this gary a vasquezusa today sports a potential snag in noah chasing this award could be a decreased minutes mark he averaged a career high in minutes per game during this load could be lessened in due to noahs bout with plantar fasciitis he may receive longer periods of rest so his body doesnt wear down this is honestly the best decision for noahs career longevity and the bulls longterm success they need a healthy noah come the playoffs however this could stunt noahs run at the defensive player of the year award because he may see his blocks steals and defensive play digits dwindle it could be enough where his overall defensive numbers are no longer overly eyepopping noah is certainly one the games premier defensive weapons he is already revered but a few tweaks could help him garner further attention as the best in the business hopefully this can happen without his health being compromised follow haddonanderson
4 mike dantoni will get a chance to implement his system with the los angeles lakers in and it is quite likely that it will work the offense was somewhat of a mess last season because the players were not an ideal fit for the spread pickandroll offense the coaching staff struggled to pair up dwight howard and pau gasol which compromised the floor spacing by the time the postseason began dantoni had a better grasp on how to utilize both centers together granted this occurred with kobe bryant out of the lineup with an achilles tear and steve nash sitting out because of hamstring issue thus gasol was used as a point center it was a great adjustment by the coaches but los angeles will get away from that and go back to the classic version of the dantoni offense the system will rely on a steady dose of pickandrolls from multiple angles on the floor with nash orchestrating things he will be tasked with finding his rolling big man or hitting shooters who get loose because of rotating defenders the offense is quite simple for a great point guard given that it requires the ballhandler to make a few reads adjust to the defense and hit the open man espn coms beckley mason did a great job of breaking down the spread pickandroll offense over at hoopspeak depending on where nash roams with his dribble he can manipulate the defense into a few predictable responses and because they ran the same look on possessionafterpossession gameaftergame they got really really good at running it especially nash who got to make the same reads overandover and because he happens to be a phenomenal shooter with great vision he was able to run the best offense in the league nash is terrific in this system by virtue of the fact he can make every pass in the book and is also quite content with being the setup man dantoni was successful with this offense in his stint as the phoenix suns head coach because his point nash consistently manufactured easy shots at the rim and threepoint looks andrew d bernstein getty images pau gasol of the la lakers in los angeles there will be a new wrinkle to the system as a result of gasols talents the spaniard is quite adept at catching on the move and finishing at the rim with either hand also his lowpost game gives the lakers an added dimension which allows the offense to be successful even with nash resting things get a bit more interesting when nash and gasol work together on the pickandroll indeed the twotime champion gasol is a threat when rolling to the hoop and he will also drift towards the freethrow line where he can connect on midrange jumpers furthermore gasol is great in the pickandpop game because he pulls away big men from the paint and opens up the floor for his teammates the laker center is an excellent passer and consequently teams will have trouble rotating off shooters when he moves to the top of the key after setting a screen watch below as gasol connects with chris kaman during the preseason this will give a player like nick young some room to operate and isolate defenders young loves showing off his ballhandling skills in setting up the man guarding him hell then attack the paint or settle for a jumper because passes and subsequent defensive rotations will spread the floor young will get the opportunity to execute the plays at which he is best keep in mind young is a career percent shooter from deep which means that he will stretch defenses and put pressure on defenders having to close out on him in the event the opposition abandons him and rotates towards gasol the former los angeles clipper will be afforded with open shots from downtown that jordan farmar can run this offense as well promises to be a fascinating aspect to the upcoming season obviously the backup point guard is nowhere near the passer or shooter that nash is but he is a solid playmaker who is particularly good in the pickandroll he sports a healthy career average of assists per minutes which is a really good figure for a reserve point guard as a reference point howard eisley was once upon a time one of the best backup point guards in the league and finished his career averaging assists per minutes steve blake is another candidate to spell nash and his numbers are quite similar to farmars the notable difference between them is that the latter is more aggressive offensively and thus is better at breaking down a defense when he turns the corner and gets into the paint dantoni can use either of them depending on the situation and even play them together at times given blakes threepoint shooting proficiency moreover things become incredibly complicated for opponents when we factor bryant into the offense the shooting guards return to the lineup after an achilles tear and knee procedure comes with some uncertainty but it seems clear at this point he will rejoin his teammates eventually the lakers alltime leading scorer is unquestionably a great setup man although he does not always look to play that part he is a complete scorer who will consistently feast on a singlecoverage defensive scheme throw a couple of defenders his way though and the artistry will come out whether he is in the pickandroll or in isolation bryant will scan the defense find the highpercentage play and execute it hence the lakers will use the twotime finals mvp as an offtheball threat where he can catch and immediately attack his defender after an initial pickandroll the offense even in its simplest sets will be a bit more complex and nuanced with bryant as the primary ballhandler in that setting he will attack off the bounce and manufacture a shot either for himself or a teammate depending on the game situation andrew d bernstein getty images indeed bryant is more likely to call his number even when completely covered late in fourth quarters and the stats bear that out in bryant attempted field goals in minutes of clutch time which is defined by nba com as the last five minutes of the game with the scoring margin within five points if we put that on a per 36minute level he averaged shots this is not an isolated pattern though bryant has shot north of clutch shots per minutes every year since the season after shaquille oneal was traded away to the miami heat except in the campaign when he averaged clutch shots per minutes however dantoni might be able to coax the 2guard into surrendering the lategame offense to nash because the twotime mvp is a great passer defenses will give nash different looks but will not always play him for the jump shot that is nice problem to have for the lakers considering how great of a shooter nash is granted he will not always dictate the direction of the possessions in a perfect world he would split those duties with bryant and remove some of the predictability that comes with the fivetime world champions isolations the tandem of nash and bryant will probably have to find a common ground on this front in order to consistently produce great looks when crunch time arrives dantonis offense will maximize the talents of the lakers players and continuously place them in situations where they will be successful hence expect the purple and gold to have an elite offense in the lakers will make a bit of noise in the western conference and put pressure on some of the teams vying for a playoff spot ultimately they will miss the postseason but it will not be because of their point totals
4 much to the dismay of dwyane wade and miami heat fans kevin durant recently stated that james harden should replace wade on sports illustrateds list of the top players in the league during an interview with cine sports per the palm beach post wade bristled heat fans bristled however wade and those fans are overlooking one simple fact about what durant said he had a point at this stage of wades career he is not an elite superstar anymore he is still a star theres no doubt about that he is one of the top three shooting guards in the nba and belongs in the discussion for top overall but he isnt better than harden now if this were or even the beginning of i would agree with those who oppose durants statement wade was younger then he was sprier he was more explosive this is though and wade has lost more than just a step thanks to his balky knees he does not possess the same athleticism he once did and his overall performance has suffered as a result thats not to say that he hasnt been darn good because he has he just isnt as good as he once was and he is not better than harden not in oct you want proof lets examine what the two of them did last season dwyane wade vs james harden in playerppgrpgapgfg 3pt ft ts efg usg dwsws 48wade21 255 152 125 872 557 152 829 53 5 192harden25 94 95 543 836 885 16050 4293 206source basketball referencewade held a significant advantage over harden in fieldgoal percentage but thats it and thats even negligible when you consider harden was far superior from threepoint range and the freethrow line not only was harden nearly a full percent better from the stripe but he averaged free throws per game to wades harden is even beginning to catch up to wade defensively while he will likely never be as good of a defender as wade was in his prime he is not nearly as far off at this stage as you would believe and the statistics support that another thing to take notice of is the usage percentage of both players even though wade had a higher usage percentage than harden not by much but it was still higher nonetheless harden still put up better numbers thats telling as a matter of fact a legitimate argument can be made that harden was better across the board than wade in too but we wont go there we have to consider how poor of a showing harden had in the nba finals against wade and the heat that year but right now isnt relevant this is about the current point in time and wade is losing his superstar clout usa today sports its and harden has surpassed wade notice that i didnt say that wade isnt a top10 player as a matter of fact one can argue that russell westbrook not wade should be replaced by harden on the list westbrook is a very good player but sports illustrated ranking him in the top five ahead of tim duncan and kobe bryant seems a bit ludicrous all i am saying is that wade is beginning to fade and durants statement is indicative of that do you really think durant would have said what he did if this were the wade of two or three years ago doubtful highly doubtful but durant sees what many of us see he sees an outstanding talent and a consistent biggame performer who is regularly dealing with knee problems and watching his production diminish as a consequence its not a knock on wade its just the laws of nature the older you get the less apt you are to dominate games the future hall of famer is falling victim to a predator that every athlete succumbs to at some point father time is undefeated wade has made a living out of snaking through defenses and drawing contact at the rim however the more contact a player draws the more of a toll his body absorbs and you can see that all of the beatings he has taken over the years have had their effect his performance during the postseason was symptomatic of this he was strangely passive averaging career lows in fieldgoal attempts and freethrow attempts dwyane wades playoff numbers vs career ppgfgaftats efg ws 48201316 114 33 649 845 9 108career23 7187 755 449 2 171source basketball referenceyou can try to spin it any way you want but the fact of the matter is that while wade is still verygood he is not the same anymore he is no longer a consistently dominant force he can be dominant for stretches but he has to pick his spots in the past he never had to pick and choose like that he could just go out and do it because he was fully capable he was younger he was healthy in that isnt the case anymore yes we have been fortunate enough to witness the brilliant career of a surefire hall of famer but we are also sadly observing his steady decline durant knows it i know it you know it wade can take names and write motivational notes to himself all he wants but deep down he knows it too issac baldizon getty images maybe wade will turn back the clock this season and demonstrate that he can make it through an 82game campaign and the playoffs with no ailments while maintaining an elite level of performance all the way through maybe we will see the wade we saw in when he was the top dog on the heat even with lebron james and chris bosh in tow but i just dont see it happening well see a very good player well see a guy who will occasionally put his team on his back and who may drop once or twice but we wont see the wade we once did that wade is gone and father time not wade himself is the culprit
4 we know what kobe bryants role will be when he returns for the los angeles lakers but the same cant be said of steve nash whose uncertain health and indefinite role make his impact much harder to predict thats why the 39yearold point guard could wind up being the player with the biggest influence on los angeles fate in the seasonfor better or worse known commoditynot convinced think about it like this bryant has essentially played with one mindset his entire career despite shifting coaching philosophies and a rotating cast of teammates he knows hes out there to be the teams alpha dog primary scoring option and lategame gunner yes hes dabbled briefly with the notion of being a facilitator but those dalliances have never lasted for more than a few games at a time craig mitchelldyerusa today spo generally speaking bryant looks to score in isolation takes plenty of shots and tends to control possessions during crunch time its just who he is so whenever he manages to get his body ready to play this season thats the guy well see undoubtedly hell have to find a way to cope with the reduced athleticism that should result from his torn achilles but his experience competitiveness and finely tuned post game are going to allow him to play in a way that wont be markedly different from the style weve seen over the past years the big question marknash is a different case his injury last year wasnt of the same abrupt careeraltering quality as bryants in a way that makes it even harder to project what well see from nash this year see nash suffered a neartotal physical breakdown last season he fractured his leg early in the year and then suffered a related string of strains tweaks and sprains that resulted from his initial injury it was as though his body just couldnt get itself aligned jayne kaminonceausa today spor bryants achilles will heal and even if hes never able to cut as quickly or jump as high his game wont change nashs comprehensive collapse could have a much more significant impact on his performance because its so hard to know if hell ever be able to play significant minutes again that uncertainty means the lakers are looking at a broad range of possibilities both positive and negative they dont know what to expect from their point guard and for what its worth nash doesnt know what to expect of himself according to eric pincus ofthelos angeles times he said well see ive got to go out and find what kind of player i am now even im still trying to figure out after all the injuries and everything its been a difficult months of injuries and stuff im a little bit limited but not necessarily anything that i cant overcome ive played two basketball games since may if you count the two playoff games where i limped around its been a while it takes time to get your rhythm and timing and kind of feel confident and comfortable out there for the sake of argument lets assume nashs body will be able to hold up to the rigors of a full season if thats the case it makes the most sense to use him as a primary ballhandler in an uptempo offense that looks as much like mike dantonis phoenix suns teams as possible nash was always most effective when he was responsible for either finding open shooters or taking shots himself a creative decisionmaker and one of the greatest pure snipers to ever play nash was an elite dual threat in his prime just two years ago he was still a fantastically effective offensive player soif nash is totally healthy allowing him to function as a fulltime conventional point guard could transform the lakers into a highefficiency offense noah graham getty images but as was the case when the lakers acquired him there are bound to be issues with using nash in this way as weve established bryant doesnt really work well as a second option so even if we imagine a bestcase scenario in which nash and bryant are both healthy the lakers will still be stuck in a situation where they wont be able to get the most out of whatever talent nash still has if thats how things play out nash could wind up as a glorified decoy on offense thats far from an ideal way to maximize his considerable skills of course its also possible that if nash isnt healthy enough to handle a major role hell wind up camping out in the corner anyway using a fully healthy nash as a spotup shooter in support of bryant is something of a waste but it would be better than the worstcase alternative in which nash simply cant do anything else if his physical deterioration picks up where it left off last year nash might not be able to give the lakers much at all and even with jordan farmar on the roster as a backup at the point the lakers would lose out on the experience shooting and chemistrybuilding play that even a hobbled nash could provide digest that for a moment depending on how nash feels and how the lakers decide to use him they could either have one of the most dynamic efficient offenses in the nba or a predictable isolationheavy attack that will struggle to score at a leagueaverage rate thats some serious range the unlikely xfactoroo ready function oo player create ooyala container

maladies last year but bryant is what he is and theres a sense that whenever hes able to return he wont be all that different from the way he was before nash though is the lakers xfactor because he presents such a wide breadth of possibilities for the team theres a kind of certainty with bryant if he can play hell play well but the lakers have no idea what nash will give them
4 last season derrick rose and the chicago bulls had plenty of splainin to do rajon rondo doesnt want to be that guy and the boston celtics shouldnt want to be that team rondos still rehabilitating a torn acl in his right knee and like most other injuries in that area of the anatomy the exact timing of his return is unknown boston general manager danny ainge previously said that rondo could be ready for opening nightnot long after he pinpointed sometime in december as the target date danny ainge on suggests december return for rajon rondo chris forsberg espnforsberg september 2013thats the thing about acl injuries in particular and knee injuries in general once they happen what comes next is damn near unpredictable rose sat out the entire season to nurse his acl meanwhile ricky rubio and iman shumpert who injured his right around the same time rose did returned to their respective teams before spring hit the lesson no two knee injuries are exactly the same random unforeseen setbacks happen player psyches differ and team goals and needs vary as well mark l baerusa today sports boston and rondo can learn from rose and chicago still theres something to be taken away from how each organization approaches such a serious injury specifically with regards to the bulls and rose they subjected themselves to dizzying amounts of criticism because of how they handled their star point guards recovery and how the teams season was managed as a result boston wont want to make those same mistakes and it doesnt have to the celtics can learn from chicagos blunders and in turn take control of what is often a temperamental situation honestys the best policy jesse d garrabrant getty images ainge is already swinging and missing in the truth department on more than one occasion hes indicated the celtics arent tanking these are the same celtics who really dont have a legitimate center plan on playing the jeff green at shooting guard from time to time and who gutted the core of their roster in favor of more draft picks than youd care to count no matter thats typical behavior for tanking teams coaches general managers and players are unlikely to come right out and admit to throwing an entire season theres a different dynamic to the injury game though ainge and the celtics cannot afford to create a false sense of hope by suggesting a time when rondo will return if he doesnt take the floor when they intimate he will scathing commentary will flow freely like natty lite at a costconscious house party this is one of the spots where the bulls went wrong coach tom thibodeau was never behind the mic predicting rose would play tomorrow but he and the bulls played the i dont know card for far too long rose wasnt really ever ruled outfor the season until chicago met the miami heat in the second round of the playoffs david dow getty images chicagos public approach to roses injury was too little too late by then it was too late it was months earlier that rose had been cleared to play and he had already admitted he was entertaining the idea of sitting out the entire year either he or the bulls should have come out and said they were shutting him down for the season then if he returned it would have been a pleasant surprise the nba isnt a roulette table in vegas sometimes there are takebacks something the celtics would do well to remember uncertainty is already defining rondos return what with ainge guessing when rondo will play again which he shouldnt do ever neither ainge nor rondo himself can predict whats going to happen next the point guard admitted as much during an interview with csnnes a sherrod blakely i definitely understand yes i understand he rose got a lot of heat for why he didnt come back everybody who has had an acl injury understands its not something you can just say ok minnesota vikings allpro running back adrian peterson came back in six months why did he come back in six months or eight months or months everybodys injury is different things can happen differently within the knee the human body can react differently you have swelling you have cartilage you just so many things can happen that may cause a setback mentally everyones different i talked to a lot of guys i talked to perk former celtic and rondos bff kendrick perkins i talked to t a former celtic tony allen i talked to former new england patriot wide receiver wes welker i think everyone of them told me they wished they would have waited a little longer early on i dont know is a more acceptable response than firing dates off at will a few months into the process when the use of i dont know expires and teams really still dont know talk of shutting the player down for the rest of the year makes more sense prepare for the worst covertly hope for the best thats the mindset boston must buy into overestimate the time rondo will be gone that way if and when the celtics are wrong its a happy accidentnot a monthslong debacle filled with indecision and an apparent fear of coming to terms with the truth dont put the healthy ones at risk ron hoskins getty images coach thibs is notorious for running his starters ragged when guiding contenders his norest nowater nobreather approach to winning is more acceptable last season it wasnt chicago tallied victories an impressive pull when you consider the number of untimely absences they dealt with in addition to that of roses but the bulls werent legitimate contenders not really were they going to get past the heat if the two met no and they didnt it was never going to happen not without rose who on that version of the bulls was the only player able to inject life into an otherwise anemic offense brian babineau getty images keep the healthy well healthy that much should have been clear from the first game of the season that the bulls werent going to win a title without him making the abuse of overplaying players like joakim noah and luol deng pointless noah averaged minutes per game to dengs and an injuryprone and aging kurt hinrich logged nearly more than he notched the previous season what was there to gain by doing that prolonged absences by each of them because thats what the bulls got desperate times i know i also understand the need to put the team in a position to contend should rose have come back doing so at the risk of other players who had a propensity for sustaining injuries is bad for future business hinrich and noah are still banged up and per nba coms david aldridge deng was previously frustrated with how the bulls handled his medical condition last season as he said back in chicago jo is out tonight vs memphis but he practiced yesterday both he and thibs indicated he should play in rio aggrey sam csnbullsinsider october 2013creating the illusion that youre playing for something more than you really are sans your best player wont work it didnt work for chicago and it wont work for boston the case of the celtics is different because theyre clearly tanker i mean rebuilding theyre younger and certain players can stand to play more minutes head coach brad stevens needs to get a feel for who those players are damaging the value of top prospects like avery bradley and greenneither of whom are spitting images of durabilitycan prove counterproductive spread the minutes out experiment more protect the players who are healthy instead of increasing the chance they join rondo in street clothes patience is a virtue brian babineau getty images one of the few things chicago and rose did right was waiting he didnt play and it sucked doctors cleared him to playthough in the windy city medical professionals seem to clear players so long as theyre sporting all four limbsand still he sat frustrating doesnt even begin to describe it but the bulls made it through barely and now according to rose himself have an even better version of their franchise cornerstone brian spurlockusa today sports the celtics shouldnt be opposed to playing for wiggins although the temptation for rose to rush back was therefor both rose and the bullsthey resisted though rather poorly still they thought big picture just like the celtics must do only more so chicago wasnt tanking rebuilding the way boston is now if and when rondo does return the celtics still wont be playing for anything and if by some miracle they were able to snag that seventh or eighth playoff spot in the east what will they accomplish a firstround exodus at the hands of miami or chicago a guarantee that the celtics wont land a top pick in a draft

4 i know what youre probably thinking a syracuse basketball story about the most impactful returning player its obviously c j fair lets move on after we went with the obvious choice for which freshman would be the most significant addition it would seem reasonable that wed go with fair here but fair is not the player who will affect the teams fortunes most this season that distinction is saved for rakeem christmas the junior forward out of philadelphia fair is unquestionably the teams leader and best player but we know what were going to get from him christmas is an enigma you never know from one game to the next whether he is going to bring it if he puts it together and plays consistently this year the sky is the limit for the orange the main thing cuse fans knock christmas for is his seeming lack of aggression in his first two seasons on campus he seemed to disappear from games and sometimes appeared disinterested in playing despite starting every game last season christmas averaged only about minutes per game in most instances christmas would start the game play two or three minutes then be invited to have a seat next to jim boeheim sometimes for the rest of the half what frustrates orange nation most are the flashes of dominant athleticism that dont surface with any regularity heres an example and another and one more for good measure despite his athletic gifts christmas managed only points rebounds and blocks per contest in his sophomore campaign thats not bad for only minutes of work but christmas couldnt make a consistent contribution because he always found himself on the bench for not putting his athletic ability to use maybe hes just not wired to be aggressive in an excellent feature on christmas for syracuse com donna ditota details how christmas lived with his grandmother in st croix in the virgin islands until he was its probably hard to develop an aggressive personality when you grow up on a beach rob brown christmas aau coach had this to say to ditota about christmas the perception of the islands is very laid back and very different from the northeast where its go go go in the islands its dont worry be happy hes got so much athletic ability and hes such a nice kid you gotta get rakeem to sharpen his claws and growl a little bit thats been the biggest adjustment for him because physically there are very few people walking this earth who have his athleticism if christmas can indeed sharpen his claws he will make the syracuse frontcourt a nightmare to match up with dajuan coleman will likely start at center and at and pounds he will be a load underneath that sometimes commands a doubleteam we already know what fair can do so defenses will at least have extra eyes fixated on him that will often leave christmas to be checked by someone that cant handle him physically and if he dominates his matchup things will open up for everyone else that isnt to say that christmas will be relied upon to carry the offense fair and jerami grant will probably handle the bulk of the scoring with some trevor cooney treys and tyler ennis drives sprinkled in but if christmas can throw down a few lobs back down smaller defenders and make his free throws his impact on the offense will be noticeable and just imagine what a motivated and aggressive christmas will do for the defense nate shron getty images christmas can be a differencemaker in the zone with coleman or baye keita anchoring the zone in the middle christmas will find himself out on the wings more often the forwards in boeheims signature system are responsible for among other things running threepoint shooters off the line sometimes all the way up to the elbows at and with a wingspan christmas is built to shut teams down on the perimeter if he is going hard expect to see a few threepoint attempts end up in the fifth row christmas can also be an asset against teams that like to work inside instead of hoisting it from deep he has shown his prowess as a shotblocker and with coleman clogging the paint christmas will be free to roam around and swat shots away from behind syracuse thrives on creating turnovers to turn defense into offense and if christmas is playing with energy there will be plenty of opportunities for fastbreak points there are lofty expectations this year for the orange rakeem christmas holds the key to meeting those expectations if he turns flashes of brilliance into consistent performance the path to the acc title may lead up i81 instead of tobacco road
4 the new york knicks made some solid moves this summer and its time to break down just how big an impact each new addition can have on the season with plenty of depth already there may not be room for each player to produce at a high level so theres definitely an element of competition here in training camp each player does bring a unique set of skills to the table however soexcluding nonguaranteed camp invites lets take a look at the chances each newcomer has to make an impact in new york andrea bargnani jesse d garrabrant getty images by starting bargnani the knicks would have the opportunity to build one of the leagues more unique lineups mike woodson still isnt sure of his starting lineup for the upcoming season but according to newsday it does sound like hes intrigued by the possibilities a unique player like andrea bargnani could bring to the unit considering the knicks recent success with small ball bargnani definitely fits into the system and if he can build a rapport with carmelo anthony he could be a huge difference maker for the offense playing at power forward melo benefited from plenty of spacing last season but starting alongside bargnani will give him the same room in the post without putting his body at risk against bigger opponents bargnani is certainly talented enough to make a big impact in new york but his focus and intensity have been questioned in the past and that will have to change in a city that breathes basketball and has title expectations hopefully a fresh start will breathe new life into bargnani as for the first time in his career hes on a truly competitive team with plenty of talent around him having a fiery head coach like woodson and leaders like tyson chandler and kenyon martin in the frontcourt with him should also ensure he doesnt fall astray the general consensus on the trade that brought bargnani to new york is that it was a misguided move but the former no overall pick has a genuine chance to prove himself here hes one of the biggest draft busts in recent memory but the vitriol hes received over the years has let people forget just how talented he actually is on a stacked team like this bargnani is unlikely to put up major scoring numbers but if he can shoot at a high percentage and contribute more on defensewhich we know he can do when he wants tothats all the knicks really need from him bargnani isnt just a shooter though he also has a solid post game and puts the ball on the floor better than most players his size with more space to work with we should start to see those elements of his game come to fruition on the whole new york struggled to get to the line last season and bargnani should help to solve that problem he excels at drawing and selling contact in the paint and shoots a high percentage on his foul shots not knowing how many minutes hes going to play its hard to come up with a quantitative prediction for bargnanis season but his talent and skill set should help the knicks offensive system to run more smoothly and make up for the loss of j r smiths scoring in the shortterm tim hardaway jr brian babineau getty images hardaway jr displayed some clutch shooting in his knicks debut most expect no overall pick tim hardaway jr to be nothing more than a bench warmer in his rookie season but with j r smith out for the next few weeks hes got an opportunity to earn a spot in the rotation one of the main reasons the knicks took hardaway is because he was one of the most nbaready prospects available late in the first round as weve already seen in preseason his jump shot is a legitimate weapon at this level and the stage isnt too big for him after playing at michigan in the preseason opener against the boston celtics hardaway scored points including a baseline gamewinner with seconds to go to expect hardaway to keep up that type of form throughout his rookie season is a stretch but if he proves he can be a consistent contributor off the bench he could still have a big impact on the knicks season if hardaway and iman shumpertanother player who looked great against the celticscontinue to impress on the offensive end the knicks might actually be in a position where they could trade smith and his very teamfriendly contract for an upgrade elsewhere on the court at this stage smith is clearly the superior player to hardaway so the rookie cant be expected to make up his points per game on his own it is possible however that he could average a more efficient points per game with the other points coming from guys like bargnani shumpert and amare stoudemire the next few weeks are going to be very telling for the knicks they have three young shooting guards under longterm deals and the likelihood that they keep them all is slim if hardaway and shumpert prove they can make up smiths production between themwhile also playing better defenseit wouldnt be a surprise to see smith gone in a years time beno udrih mark l baerusa today sports udrih is as good a thirdstring point guard as there is in the nba only two years ago the knicks were relying on mike bibby and toney douglas at point guard but all of a sudden its one of the more stacked positions on the roster as it stands beno udrih figures to be the thirdstringer behind raymond felton and pablo prigioni but smiths absence for the next few weeks should open up some playing time for udrih to prove himself worthy of a consistent spot in the rotation the chances of udrih making a major impact are slim considering his place in the depth chart but if felton or prigioni was to get injured his value would really come to light udrih is good enough to at least earn a backup role on most nba teams and for that reason he cant be counted out entirely to crack the rotation hes a wellrounded guard who excels at finding the open man and hitting the pullup jumper and that may force woodson to find minutes for him if he proves he manages toplay better defense than felton that may not be too difficult a proposition while udrih is certainly a solid experienced player his role on the team right now is to provide depth and though hes good enough to make a big impact on a team like this the likelihood is that he wont get the chance once smith returns metta world peace joe camporealeusa today sports world peaces offcourt presence has already been felt but its the defensive end where hell really leave an impact while the forwards offcourt activity may be a little more random the knicks know what theyre going to get out of metta world peace this season hes a tough defender who can hit the three and knows what it takes to win a championship he wont be a major scorer but he should be good for or so points a night while taking on the oppositions best forward assuming hes able to stay healthy world peace should have a low ceiling and a high basement during his tenure with the knicks there shouldnt be much fluctuationhell be one of their most important defensive players and someone to spread the floor and make the extra pass on offense in terms of intangibles world peaces experience and oncourt intensity should leave a big impact on the rest of the team based on what his new teammates have said about him hes clearly a respected player in the locker room which will help to make up for the loss of jason kidd and rasheed wallace world peace isnt the player he once was and while hes still a solid role player bargnani being in his prime has a better chance to make a bigger impact world peaces presence will still be felt but theres only so much he can contribute whereas bargnani has the talent if nothing else to be a very important piece
4 kobe bryant will return to the los angeles lakers soonwe think an exact timetable still doesnt exist per sam amick of usa today normally thats troubling in this case its merely puzzling the prevailing sentiments coming out of lakerland suggest that kobe is ahead of schedulewhatever that means opening nightoct against the los angeles clippershas always been the goal but a definitive date hasnt been set los angeles needs the sort of clarity only actual answers provide and if the lakers have them neither they nor kobe is sharing knowing just how long the team will be without kobe is critical to their success or lack thereof they need to know what it is theyre dealing with and how long theyll be playing without him if at all their season depends on it the openingnight fiesta andrew d bernstein getty images though i stand by my prediction that kobe will play on opening nightno one likes an indecisive idathelos angeles times mike bresnahan writes that its unlikely probably

center court through which kobe will rise just before tipoff to the tune ofjourneys dont stop believin were this to happen the end results could be bittersweet seeing kobe take the floor against the

82012136934 721 25 0basketballreference comas father time has started tightening his grip on wade his basketball odometer has started reading off the charts wade wouldnt trade these three straight trips to the nba finals but the result has been nearly an extra season played playoff games over that span and its not as if erik spoelstra has the luxury of protecting wade the way gregg popovich does with his elder statesmen with wade lebron james and chris bosh chewing up more than million of miamis payroll this season team president pat riley has been forced to fill his bench with pasttheirprime veterans shane battier ray allen and rashard lewis and nba outcasts chris andersen michael beasley and greg oden wades best path to preservation as he told wallace is preparing for another taxing mental grind and hoping for the best you dont want to go in thinking im going to halfass it at all were not that much better than teams where we can preserve and sit guys thats just not the way we do things so you try your best knock on wood you dont suffer any injuries he doesnt have the same athleticism to compensate for any mental lapses issac baldizon getty images his fieldgoal attempts at the rim in were his fewest over the last seven seasons via hoopdata com for the third time in his career and second straight season he shot fewer than free throws a night his career average is his block percentage last season was the lowest it had been since his injuryplagued campaign if he doesnt trust his knee then his pace of play suffers his changes of direction are slower hes late as a shotblocker or misses his flight window around the basket suddenly flash stands for flashes of greatness which come fewer and farther between without trusting his own body its harder for him to ask his teammates to do so at a time of year when almost every nba player is in the best shape of their lives it has to be a bit unnerving for the defending champs to be talking injury concerns already especially having those conversations about a player not named greg oden but the larger issue in play is that wades knee isnt the only mental hurdle hell climb this season come next summer no one knows what miamis roster will look like each member of the big three can opt out of his current contract and each would vault near the top of the freeagent class if they choose to do so james hasnt yet made up his mind so by extension neither have wade or bosh pull the best player on the planet off of this roster and suddenly miami transforms from a title contender into a secondtier playoff team wade and bosh will rightfully wait for james call before committing to anything themselves andrew d bernstein getty images its hard to say if a title in would help or hurt miamis chances of keeping the king on one hand hed look foolish to bolt from a championship club but on the other it puts a storybook ending on his fouryear run through south beach no matter how hard he tries to distance himself from this decision wade has the biggest say in james future he doesnt need to simply play at an elite levelhis player efficiency rating was still seventhbest last seasonhe has to prove he can stay at that level long enough for james to fulfill his goal of not one not two not three titles the only way for miamis salarycap issues to clear is if one or more of the big three
