<p class="ui-droppable"><img class="slot" src="/images/pixel.gif" alt=""><span class="spellcheck">Omri</span> <span class="spellcheck">Casspi</span> signed a <span class="spellcheck">multi</span>-year deal with the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/houston-rockets">Houston Rockets</a> this summer.</p> <p>This after a relatively disappointing two-season stay in <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/cleveland-cavaliers">Cleveland</a>, where he averaged career lows of 7.1, then 4.0 points per game.</p> <p>But <span class="spellcheck">Casspi</span> has looked like his old effective self this preseason, scoring 20 and 17 points in his first two Rockets outings.</p> <p>The question is whether he can sustain such play in the regular season and fill in the glaring hole at the 4-spot that the team has. <span class="spellcheck">Casspi</span>&rsquo;s shooting range could be a crucial weapon for the team, as they attempt to introduce more half-court offense in their quest for a championship.</p> <p><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/dwight-howard">Dwight Howard</a> and <span class="spellcheck">Omer</span> <span class="spellcheck">Asik</span>, of course, have no such range. Just take a look at their shot charts, from last season.</p> <p>Howard:</p> <p><img class="slot" src="/images/pixel.gif" alt=""></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span class="spellcheck">Asik</span>:</p> <p><img class="slot" src="/images/pixel.gif" alt=""></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, take a look at <span class="spellcheck">Casspi</span>&rsquo;s from last season (albeit an off year):</p> <p><img class="slot" src="/images/pixel.gif" alt=""></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span class="spellcheck">Casspi</span> didn't exactly light the world on fire from outside of the paint last year, but he was still latitudes ahead of the two natural 5&rsquo;s that the Rockets are attempting to treat like 4&rsquo;s.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s also important to note that <span class="spellcheck">Casspi</span> has excelled from beyond the arc before, at least for someone as big as 6'9": he shot 37% on three-pointers in his second season in the league. For stretch power forwards&mdash;a role the Rockets could certainly use&mdash;this is a good mark.</p> <p>Can <span class="spellcheck">Casspi</span> return to such proficiency? He was down to 33% with Cleveland last year, but he&rsquo;s been 6/12 (50%) in his preseason attempts with the Rockets. This is, of course, a terribly small sample size, but it&rsquo;s also a testament to the extra time and space <span class="spellcheck">Casspi</span> will get on all outside shots. Houston's offense is much more capable of re-directing defensive bodies than Cleveland's was.</p> <p><img class="slot" src="/images/pixel.gif" alt=""></p> <p>But <span class="spellcheck">Casspi</span> will also need to improve his free-throw percentage if he&rsquo;s to get the minutes he desires. Last year, he was a dismal 54%, making him as much of a liability in that regard as the two centers&mdash;<span class="spellcheck">Asik</span> was at 56% last year, and Howard was all the way down to 49%. <span class="spellcheck">Casspi</span>&rsquo;s a 66% shooter from the line through his career, so there&rsquo;s reason to hope he&rsquo;ll improve.</p> <p>One thing&rsquo;s for sure: he will have his chance to prove himself, at one point or another. Whether the Howard-Asik experiment pans out in the long run is a loaded question, but no one doubts that it will have its rocky moments in the short term. Houston will need a more natural 4 spending long minutes on the floor, in a good deal of games.</p> <p><img class="slot" src="/images/pixel.gif" alt=""></p> <p>And as long as he hits enough open shots, <span class="spellcheck">Casspi</span> will be doing everything he needs to for the team&rsquo;s offense. With so many dynamic scorers already in town, <span class="spellcheck">Casspi</span>&rsquo;s role is essentially that of a buoy; his range will be used to draw defenders further away from spots where they could more easily collapse on a driving <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/james-harden">James Harden</a>, Jeremy Lin or Chandler Parsons. <span class="spellcheck">Casspi</span> <span class="spellcheck">wouldn</span>&rsquo;t have the ball in his hands much.</p> <p>On the other end, <span class="spellcheck">Casspi</span>'s defense has always been at least near replacement level quality. If he does gain minutes in crucial games and is on the floor for must-stop situations, though, he'll be much less valuable to his team than <span class="spellcheck">Omer</span> <span class="spellcheck">Asik</span>, who&mdash;despite not being Dwight Howard&mdash;is one of the better defenders in the league. Expect Coach Kevin McHale to sub <span class="spellcheck">Casspi</span> and <span class="spellcheck">Asik</span> for each other pretty aggressively in certain games.</p> <p>Many have called for the Rockets to trade <span class="spellcheck">Asik</span>&mdash;as he himself has asked them to&mdash;and acquire their much-coveted stretch forward (Ryan Anderson&rsquo;s name has often come up). But if <span class="spellcheck">Omri</span> <span class="spellcheck">Casspi</span> is able to fulfill this relatively manageable role and exhibit the shooting range that he needs to, such a transaction might not be necessary. They might have their guy already. <span class="spellcheck">Casspi</span>'s range could very well be the magic ingredient to Houston maximizing much of its roster's mysterious potential.</p>
