Artificially intelligent swag from the AI group at HackMcGill HackNights.

Every Tuesday night in McGill TR3070 from 7PM onwards. Over the year we will cover stuff like:

- Machine learning
- Neural Networks
- NLP
- MapReduce/Hadoop
- General AI concepts
- Game theory
- Applications of this stuff

In python and (maybe) scala.

##overview

- October 1: Document classification using python, sklearn and naive bayes using a sample dataset pulled from hackerrank.com
- October 8: Using oct1 in real life. Scraping news websites and classifying their articles our way in python. We all worked on a part of the scraper. Next week we're going to talk about how we put it together.
- October 15: Putting the scraper together. Testing classification. Improvements on this? Additional resources, and "how do we make this more intelligent?" -> intro to NLP (maybe if we have time).
