Artificially intelligent swag from the AI group at HackMcGill HackNights.

Every Tuesday night in McGill TR3070 from 7PM onwards. Over the year we will cover stuff like:

- Machine learning
- Neural Networks
- NLP
- MapReduce/Hadoop
- General AI concepts
- Game theory
- Applications of this stuff

In python and (maybe) scala.
